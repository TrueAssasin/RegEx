"Where to start? I came on here because I wanted to get flappy bird but when I saw this I thought it was basically the same thing but it's even harder,more frustrating and annoying,doesn't react straight away and I don't get what's with the poo. I want flappy bird!!!!!!!!",0
"Really Disappointed in this Film I have to say I was so looking forward to this remake of superman. The trailer for the film made it look fantastic. Talk about disappointed when I watched it on Christmas day! There were good points for the film, that I didn't feel were really properly realised. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was one. She actually made me like the character, which was a first for me. I also did like the fact that Lois found out who superman was early on in the film. I always found it daft that she didn't work it out in the original film (some reporter!). I also thought Russell Crowe played the part of Jor El to perfection. The young actor that played 13 year old Clark was also fantastic. He out shone the adult version of himself by a mile!<br /><br />Newcomer Henry Cavill sadly lacked as the adult Clark Kent and Superman. He didn't make me care about him and I didn't feel connected to him at all. I really thought he would take over and make this role his, but Christopher Reeves still holds the title as the best big screen Superman as far as I'm concerned. Add to that far too many endless scenes where Superman and his enemies are being thrown through buildings, explosions from behind and punching each other up (which got tedious and boring) and you've got one big disappointment in film viewing. The whole thing gave me a headache by the end.<br /><br />Why can't film makers leave special effects as an enhancement to the film and concentrate some much needed attention on storyline and character development? After all, endless action scenes without storyline and characters you care about, will result in a film people can only watch once, rather than one that you can watch again and again. I was in a quandary about whether to watch Superman 2 with the edition of Batman (who I hate and never watch), but this has cleared things up for me. I will happily skip the second movie and not lose any sleep over it.<br /><br />If you love Superman, you're better off with the original films and TV series Smallville. Both are far better than this. Action junkies will love this version however.",0

"Not worth buying As a family we are huge Matt Damon fans, especially the Bourne series. This is NOTHING like the Bourne series. we sat down to watch it with my 14 year old and 16 year old sons, but the lack of any plot and action (besides the sort of action which makes me wonder how it only got a 15 rating) made us turn it off about 40 minutes into the movie.",0
Five Stars good buy,1
One Star Did not like at all,0
"Hand-held shakey camera rubbish A big monster attacks a city, so a guy and his friends set out to save his gal and escape the carnage. Ancient story, yes, but with a new lease of life in the form of a Blair Witch Project-type perspective (hand-held shaky camera).  The movie starts in a city centre apartment during a party where all of the main characters are celebrating the lead actors new job in Japan. These main characters happen to be a bunch of twenty-something, good looking, loud, irritating New Yorkers who I did not care about in the least. The festivities are rudely interrupted when something explodes nearby and decapitates the Statue of Liberty. The said main characters set out on their rescue mission while avoiding the Army and a giant Godzilla like Alien.<br /><br />Stripped of conventional editing and music, in this movie experiment we have 90 minutes of shaky camera work though which we view the goings on. This is like watching a movie from the comfort of your washing machine in the middle of a 40 degree cycle. It is a nauseating experience.<br /><br />The movie itself is not good as I felt no compassion whatsoever for the main characters. They are archetypal and there is no character depth. We don't know what these characters are like, so we don't really care for them. In fact I was hoping they would all get munched by the Alien. I felt no hatred for the Alien as we only caught a few sightings of it (a fleeting leg here, a tail there, full length on News footage), and ultimately the movie is an empty experience. Cloverfield never explains its monsters arrival. In fact, the monster is a minor character; this movie is all about five annoying New Yorkers running around a ground zero type area with a camera.<br /><br />The only scary scene is when the heroes are trapped in a tunnel (Underground subway) and they are chased by baby aliens. Clearly, the director was watching the Vin Diesel masterpiece - Pitch Black- and used the exact same creatures in the same circumstances- under the cover of darkness. Total rip off.<br /><br />For me cinema is all about mellifluous dialogue, intricate framing, a good soundtrack and good acting on top of a great story. This movie experiment failed on all counts. It made me feel nauseous with its shaky camera work and poor story line. Disappointing.al rip off.

"A disappointingly flat album, that doesn't take off I was hostile to Muse when this album came out and most of my friends were raving about it, and looking back, I remember why I was hostile. As much as I tried to like Muse, I just couldn't. Perhaps it was a naff album to try and get into for Muse, but it's a boring, flat album that just doesn't take off. All of the songs are unmemorable, disappointing, and like the Queen comments, when you look into it really deeply you will be surprised of how much they are alike.   Give credit to Muse though, they must be doing very successful at pulling in the thousands of loyal fans - But I just don't get what the hype is about. If the Glastonbury performances are anything to go by, they put on some great shows but most of this album seems like nothing but filler. It's song varies too widely to be able to define it as an album. It just isn't captivating enough to say I enjoy the album.   Matt Bellamy seems to polarise people as well. I enjoy synth music as much as the next person - And Kraftwerk, Jean Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream... All great music makers. But why? There were no vocals, and especially no Matt Bellamy warbling on, distracting the attention away from the music itself.",0
"Bones and Booth, happy families? Bones and Booth settling into 'happy families' was a bit of a different style to what 'Bones' followers have been used. Still fascinating insight into Forensic goings on supposedly at the Jeffersonian makes up for the new domesticated Bones and Booth. Whilst its supposed to reflect real life its obviously not going to be to everyone's taste and would not be a good idea if this formula was continued in later series and could lose fans ultimately. Bring back Zack and pit him and Hoskins together again would also boost what now is looking like scriptwriters stuck for ideas.",0

"Good album but I already know all the best songs on it I know Genesis primarily through their excellent 3CD Best Of called The Platinum Collection.  I have since heard Trespass, Foxtrot, A Trick of the Tail, Duke and We Can't Dance.  So far I have been disappointed by the albums.  I have yet to find a song that didn't make it onto The Platinum Collection that's above okay.      In my experience the albums are fairly weak and that all the good stuff has been collected on The Platinum Collection.  If you don't already own it then the albums might satisfy you a lot more.  Nothing great appears to have been left behind.  And the albums are not as conceptually tight and of one whole piece as I expected.      1. \\""""Behind the Lines\\"""" - 5:31 (5 out of 5 stars)  Tuneful rocker with good lyrics and punchy drums.    2. \\""""Duchess\\"""" - 6:26 (5 stars)  A great and easily digested extended prog track.  It sounds like a straight forward song but still distinctly prog.    3. \\""""Guide Vocal\\"""" - (Banks) 1:35 (1 star)  Bland short song fragment.  Filler that says less than the band thinks it does.    4. \\""""Man of Our Times\\"""" (Rutherford) - 5:34 (2 stars)  Awkward, messy sounding song that just doesn't sound right.    5. \\""""Misunderstanding\\"""" (Collins) - 3:13 (5 stars)  Nice heartfelt song.    6. \\""""Heathaze\\"""" (Banks) - 4:59 (3 stars)  Too slow and subdued for my tastes, but it has some brief loud sections that sound great.  Lyrics are interesting during the second half.    7. \\""""Turn It On Again\\"""" - 3:50 (5 stars)  Loud straight forward rocker.  Lyrically of no great substance but better than what most bands usually come up with when doing simple songs.  A song of considerable craftsmanship.    8. \\""""Alone Tonight\\"""" (Rutherford) - 3:56 (2 stars)  Slow ballad that opens into something big and slightly bloated.  A bit boring.  Competent but banal and trite.  If I was to never hear it again I wouldn't be bothered.    9. \\""""Cul-de-sac\\"""" (Banks) - 5:05 (3 stars)  Starts great with big symphonic drums and lyrics about armies.  Unfortunately it fails to deliver on its opening promise.    10. \\""""Please Don't Ask\\"""" (Collins) - 4:01(3 stars)  Okay and melodic but unremarkable.  Nothing wrong with it, just a bit bland.    11. \\""""Duke's Travels\\"""" - 8:40 (3 stars)  Eventful near instrumental (vocals only start 6 minutes in) that rocks out.  Clearly an important track but it feels a bit like filler to me.    \\""""Duke's End\\"""" - 2:08 (4 stars)  Short instrumental hard rock reprise of the opening track \\""""Behind the Lines\\"""".      Duke is a solid 55 minute album.  It has four great songs (\\""""Turn It On Again\\"""", \\""""Behind the Lines\\"""", \\""""Duchess\\"""" and \\""""Misunderstanding\\"""") that are already available on the Best Of and it has some weaker tracks that range from rubbish to okay.  If you don't have The Platinum Collection then put the overall score up to four stars.  If you do have it, and listen to it quite a lot, then I don't think this album has much to offer.",0

"Bond is falling, but not fallen Honestly, this is not bad - it's not great either, but it's not terrible.<br /><br />The good things? Great opening credits, a sensible plot that has pace, all the major plots are resolved neatly.<br /><br />The bad things? I struggled with the lack of tension. There were no great reveals or surprise twists.<br /><br />The story itself had been done before with Golden Eye (rogue MI6 agent perceives betrayal and takes on the establishment before Bond takes him out). The chase scene a the beginning, although impressive, was too similar to that in Quantum of Solace only taken a bit further.<br /><br />This is not the worst Bond by a long way, but I feel I'm being generous by giving it 3/5",0
"Behind his time possibly? In trying to stay \\""""with it\\"""" has he made a boring album? Well maybe, but it does still have the \\""""Todd\\"""" sound in here. His fans I'm sure will think he can do no wrong and possibly he can't, but this does boarder on weak, although the songs do have a strong feel to them.<br />The rhythm machine is in full swing with many electronic appliances in evidence, plus authentic instruments as well, of course. This is not to say it's a bad thing as they suit the music. But at times it actually lingers in the eighties electric movement.<br />I have to say that I've aways loved to move within music and I had hope Todd Rundgren's new release would have done the same, but alas it falls well short in my book.<br /><br />There is a great DVD that comes with this release, some may say self indulgent, but I think he has enough fans to really appreciate this. It is fun and has a relaxing feel, with a gig at a small club type venue, concluding with a pleasant interview at the end.<br /><br />I still like his attitude to life and his lyrical content is as always on the money, (hippieisam lives here, just), but he seems lost in his musical direction unless you yourself are still there with him, in which case you may still like this project as it does have merit.",0

"PS - I hated it.................Sentimental drivel ! Due to all the hype - I just had to read this book and boy, was it an effort. Think 'Chicken soup for the soul' meets 'Highway to Heaven' meets badly written chic-lit and you've got 'PS-I love you'. Fair play to the young Writer - she must have some talent as the book is selling well - Having struggled through it though, I don't know why? Anyone laughing or weeping whilst reading this drivel is either demented or has a lot of 'issues'  <br />I'm sure it will sell well in the USA - they like this sentimental, touchy/feely krud. My copy now resides in my bathroom. There, it serves some use - I can just about bring myself to wipe with it.  Not worth the money and doesn't live up the hype. <br />Buy toilet roll instead - Its cheaper and more interesting not to mention more effective.",0

"Embarrassing I don't know which actor made me cringe more. Nicholson and Keaton's characters flounce around like teens in heat, hysterical (not funnily so)and gruesomely self-indulgent by turns. Not remotely believable or sympathetic. Long before the mid-way point I ceased to give a damn about them or their love-lives. And poor Keanu is a mere cipher in this sorry mess. He looks bemused most of the time -  as in, what the hell am I doing in this? kind of bemused. Barely a decent laugh in it either. Actually, two stars is probably pretty generous.",0
"Irritating I could not believe the author who is not a young girl, could write such nonsense about a young girl being so totally submissive for a guy who is nothing more than a bully.<br />I detested it. The descriptions of the sex must have been derived from text books of some kind as it was just too repetitive and boring to be true.",0

"Wrong Wrong Wrong First off, a gripe. Any review that starts \\""""This is the first Metal record I ever bought...\\"""" and within a few sentences includes \\""""its the best metal guitar work going\\"""" needs to be disregarded. This is not heavy, but it is metal-ish. Compared to the average 13-20 year olds perception of what a metal album is, this is probably some rocking stuff, however, I am talking about a generation that dont know who pantera were, think Cannibal Corpse was a joke in Ace Ventura, and are sure they have something by At The Gates on a victory records sampler they got free at a less than jake gig. Sick. <br />As a bitter and twisted, long-suffering and experienced lover of metal, I couldnt help but think this album was a tad corny, and the whole scene of this type of band (shadows fall, all that remains etc) seem to sound a lot like In Flames, maybe thats the problem. If you have anything in your collection by At the Gates, Black Dahlia Murder, Death, Dillinger Escape Plan or suchlike, then this is probably best avoided....you heard it ten years ago. <br />Go and buy Epitaph by Necrophagist instead, now that could be the best guitar work I ever heard......",0

Just like fifty shades and if I may say so we readers were led to belive it was a trilogy, the book in its self was ok nothing like the first two that were hot and had a story to them this book was so slow it took me quite a while to read it cos id get boared and put it down and then go back to it. There was not alot of cary in it, I thought he was a great character and wanted to find out more about him. As I say all in all in was an ok book but when I got to the end and this little bit was there from sylvia day saying yes your right there story isint finished yet I to be honest flung the book across the room we waited so long for this book it kept getting put back and back, god knowns when we will get the next book shame on you sylvia day I take it money is more importent than the fans you say you love.",0

"Poor Mengelberg I wanted this box primarily to replace my old LPs of the Matthew Passion and Brahms Requiem, undoubtedly great performances of their kind, with the bonus of a complete Beethoven cycle and other attractions. Alas, my hopes of cleaned-up sound with the greater sonic range of most self-respecting modern transfers of this kind of material were not realised. Both choral works have insuperable woolly sound of limited range. Others, such as the Bartok Violin Concerto and Beethoven 9th, merely (to my ears) copy rather poor existing sound, as heard in the earlier Concertgebouw issue of live Mengelberg recordings. The Schubert 9th is in tolerably ok sound. But I'm sure that, given a Ward Marston or Obert-Thorn or, indeed, any of the several fine transferors now coming on stream, much more could have been done to clarify and enhance the originals. So caveat emptor, even if you are a Mengelberg neophyte - persist only if you are in a rush to own a good cross-section of the work of this unparalleled orchestral trainer and remarkably distinctive interpreter.",0

"Not classic Oldfield, but worth a listen! Well, what should we expect of someone who's pretty much done it all? This is fairly lightweight stuff, with a vocalist I had not heard of before, and it has clearly been made one song a a time, and then strung together.  Some are eminently forgettable, but we really liked Dreaming in the Wind, where Mike does a better<br />Hank Marvin than Hank can!  There are a couple of others that the kids liked too.  Overall a complete success? No.  Should have been a three or four track single, or the stronger songs saved for a future album.",0
faulty Hi<br /><br />Unfortunately i tried watching this film recently and found that it did not play. The blu ray player rejected the disc and on closer inspection i found that it had a hairline crack on the disc. When the disc arrived i was on holiday and due to work commitments and other things i did not actually get a chance to watch the film until after 28 days of delivery. I had already seen this on the big screen and on DVD so i wasn`t really that bothered about watching it urgently on blu ray. I tried to go onto your website to return it and order a new disc but it would not let me. The disc is still as new but obviously not sealed.<br />I would appreciate it if i could return this item for a replacement one.<br />Thank You,0

"Could do better This book has no literary value.  It is badly written, full of mistakes and the action is uninvolving.  The characters are without reality, the plot should be exciting and thrilling but utterly fails to convince.  It would help if someone had shot the editor at some point (or perhaps they did...) as he/she seems to have entirely given up half way through and produces such gems as 'the shell wheezed past'.  I am horrified that this author purports to teach writing, perhaps she should learn to write first.",0

"Moving yet sometimes superficial exploration of adoption When a tiny baby named Asha (a name which means Hope) is adopted from an Indian orphanage by an American couple who can't have children, you'd think it could almost be a happy ending. Yet this is just the beginning of this story, which spans more than 20 years and describes everything from the birth mother's decision to give up her daughter to the daughter's return to India in search of her roots and some explanations. In The Secret Daughter, nothing is quite as it seems. Even Asha turns out to have actually been named Usha (meaning Dawn) by her birth mother Kavita, who is already traumatised by the infanticide of her first daughter and makes the long journey to the orphanage at Shanti to deliver Usha there in the hope of saving her life.<br /><br />Adoptive parents Somer and Krishnan Thakkar, both doctors, have been unable to have children and see the adoption of Asha as their much-desired chance to start a family. Yet again there is more to the story: as Asha grows up they begin to realise the sometimes vast cultural gulf between them, and the cracks in their relationship start to show. Rather than bringing them together, Asha's increasing interest in her Indian heritage sets her parents at odds with each other. Will Asha find out more about who her mother was, and why she gave her away? Will Somer ever become comfortable with her Indian in-laws and the part of her husband that will always yearn for India?<br /><br />This is really a book about lots of things (adoption, growing up, family) but it is particularly moving in its description and understanding of the mother/daughter relationship. There are some really beautifully written parts of this book, and the subject matter - unwanted female childen, infertility and adoption - comes from many different perspectives and is moving and well worth exploring. But somehow this book failed to go beyond the superficial for me. I found the writing style somewhat sterile and lacking in depth. Although it was a very interesting topic, and at times tackled very well, as a whole I did not find this book very satisfying.at times tackled very well, as a whole I did not find this book very satisfying.",0

"MadMen is anagram of Amen DM (doc martin boot) The faux mid century pastels colo(u)rs set against grey suits are quite unrrealistic and nauseating to my high tastes (and low spelling)<br />This is a casusal play for playsters and loveys and posseurs and actors to watch - not for class or true consumption.<br />It is ESSENCELESS - it has no grounding no wonder force, it is purely character based, a void a vacuum.<br />It is for those that can can only 'see' other people and not anything deeper - but done well within that zone.<br />What is in Wagner and Mozart and Shakespreare and the fine poets and playrights that separates these magicians from those that think they know?<br />- well it is the very thing that is missing here - that is the 'thing' of which i speak.<br />The fact that so many apparently good critics like it - tells me that 90% of them are not truly in touch with that makes genius amd are in effect amateuronions.<br />DM Amen.",0

"A novel of unfulfilled good intentions. I have just finished reading this novel and I was very keen to see the reflections of other reviewers who have also read this book.  It expectedly seems to have divided opinion, although the majority of it is admittedly positive and I can see why.  On the surface this is an easy book to like, it's written in the tradition of Mark Twain and JD Salinger, two of the most successful and iconic voices of childhood and adolescence.  It takes on difficult, perhaps brave, subject matter and it is intensely focussed on maintaining the \\""""humanity\\"""" of its characters.  Donoghue lets us know that Jack and Ma are human beings who deserve our empathy and are not just two-dimensional victims requiring our default and disconnected sympathy.  Of course Donoghue has very little choice in taking this approach, anything other would be too obviously crass and exploitative, not to mention dull, yet I believe the author deserves credit for committing to her characters as people and not making them faceless sympathy sponges.<br />The story is also original enough and is full of potential, Donoghue has the bravery to not just tackle difficult subject matter but to also have this set in a single room (for a large part of the book at least) and then, to mention her most significant challenge, she attempts to tell her entire story via the first person narrative of a five year old child.  If Donoghue could make this work then she would've written a masterpiece and there are plenty of reviewers who believe that she did just that, I, for my part, am not among them.<br />This book has its moments.  Giving a child a voice is important in my view, society often struggles to recognise the emotions and psychologies of its younger members.  It's not so long ago that children were extremely marginalised and ignored as general practice by families, teachers, etc, their elder counterparts preferring to have them seen rather than heard.  Children may be ignorant of many things but that does not make their voices meaningless, Donoghue addresses this fact and, symbolically at least, helps to open up a connection between child and adult via her novel.  It's the quality of this connection that must be called into question, however.  Other reviewers have said that the child's voice just doesn't hold up as authentic and I must agree.  The character of Jack requires a gargantuan suspension of disbelief which means that we really are only left with a symbol, or an extremely distorted representation, of the reality of a five year old child.  His language is too complex and his deeds, one deed in particular, feel far beyond his years, Donoghue has created something human in Jack but she hasn't created a fully consistent and credible character, just a fusion of adult and child, with the child part actually less aparent than the adult in many instances.  I have to conclude that Donoghue fails to realise Jack in the sort of realistic form that would really make this story worthwhile and the novel fails to be anything more than a curiosity as a result of this.<br />There are compelling aspects to the novel, there are also extremely tedious parts, particularly the final third.  I understand what Donoghue was attempting towards the end of the novel, she was counting on the fact that the reader would be so deeply wedded to the characters that they would be desperate to see them negotiate the outside world successfully, for me, it was a miscalculation.  Everything Donoghue had to offer in this novel came with the first part of the narrative, namely the part set in Room.  Having the excitement of the part that follows this is fine as a short burst of interest but it undermines the psychological and otherworldy character that Room represented and the Room really is the central character of this book, more so than Jack even.  Donoghue has nothing interesting to say about the outside world, nor does she have any interesting characters to offer us in the shape of Jack's family, the fact thatshe spends so much time writing about these things demonstrates, to me at least, that Donoghue had lost focus in terms of trying to write something meaningful and instead chose to go through the motions of storytelling, hoping that the inspiration that had driven her to make this brave attempt in the first place would carry her through.  It doesn't and the novel limps to its conclusion.<br />Could Room have been something more? Perhaps, I feel that it would take an author of greater insight to find that story however.  Donoghue only scratches the surface and on this offering I'm left with the impression that that is all she is really capable of.  Unlike some reviewers, however, I wish to stress that I believe Donoghue had all the right intentions for this book, I just don't think she was up to realising them.",0

"Leicester Bangs Review (2010): The Orb featuring David Gilmour - Metallic Spheres (Columbia)<br />The Orb, or Alex Paterson as his Mum calls him, and David Gilmour first collaborated on a cover of Graham Nash's \\""""Chicago\\"""" for a charity project. They obviously got on because producer Youth was invited to join them for Metallic Spheres, an album of two parts, and designed to be heard in just that way.<br /><br />Part one, the \\""""Metallic Side\\"""" and the second part, \\""""Spheres Side\\"""", are both beat-heavy soundscapes - there are scattered vocals - with Gilmour's guitar, though treated and manipulated, recognizable throughout. The result can be compared most readily to the Eno / Fripp collaborations of the `70s, though neither of the pieces here can compare to the glacial majesty of  \\""""Heavenly Music Corporation\\"""", or even a \\""""Swastika Girls\\"""", but it has its moments, often before the beats become overbearing. 6/10.",0

Thanks for reading my review, I don't mean to sound bossy I'm just trying to help. :-)",1
"Relax, let the film happen around you Initially, I found the film hard going. The story threads are tightly told, and if you concentrate too hard on understanding what and why things are happening, you won't understand. Stop trying to understand, and let the narrative speak for itself. Once I let go, and just kept up with the stories, it was just beautifully told.<br /><br />The acting is great, the fight scenes not too drawn out, and satisfyingly, all the questions you have are answered sufficiently.<br /><br />I loved it.",1

essential prior reading to a visit to New York difficult to assemble a plan of action from. Lots of useful information but no way to tie together a schedule of what you might want to do once there.

For under a £10 its well worth buying to get ready for the trip of a life time.,0

"...'still waiting for the classic follow up to these days ' First of all let me start by saying i am the worlds biggest bon jovi fan,ever since i saw livin' on a p[rayer the video when i was 7 in '89....HOWEVER .... they havent released a great album since These days !! Crush,Bounce,Have a nice day.. ok albums too.. but c'mon.. this isnt the same band that released These Days,Faith,Jersey,Slippery.. !!! This last album i'm not sure if ill even go out and buy it,I currently have a burned copy..but like the last few its not great.Obviously they still have a couple great Bon Jovi tunes on each of the last few albums(Undivided,wrong side of right,next 100 years,its my life,have a nice day,save the world,hook me up,love me back to life,i wanna be loved,i could make a livin' outta lovin' you,(and possibly 1 of my fav b.jovi tunes ever.. dirty little secret)..but nothing that could ever touch any of the 90's number's.  <br />I hate to say this and it pains me so much.. but what went wrong..Why.. how did this turn out like this.. They havent been able to write an excellent album in full anymore.. instead they are leaning towards easy listening pop ballady tunes.. (Ok they've always been pop-rock,but these days they are too popy) I still love Bonjovi,they are still 1 of the best live acts in the world .. but it just pains me that they are well able to do better and they should of had out at least 1 great album since the turn of the millennium. <br />-In terms of this album,there are some great anthems,some decent ballads.. but its just a stop gap for the fans..an experiment album.. like this left feals right.. so i cant wait for their next one.. hope it will be the classic follow up to these days that wev'e all been waiting for!!  <br />I wish that their next album will finally hit the heights as the 90's and before ... but with the greatest hits world tour coming up next year - possibly with a crossroads 2 album,i can't wait to see them again !! <br /> <br />*Dont look up to your movie screens <br />your record stores or magazines <br />Close your eyes and you will see <br />That you are all you really need* <br />                           -jbj",0

"Great for the Price! could be more polished. I live in the US. I bought this set after hearing of others in the US reccomend it because it was cheaper and also Reigion Free. The first 6 discs have &#34;for Rental&#34;printed on them. I cannot see the difference between these and the regular US version. I do think the first 2 movies could be cleaned up for the HD port. They mostly look like a straight port from DVD, But that seems to be the case for the US versions also. All include extra scenes and features so I am a fan of that. Overall the best buy for the Collection (untill they clean up the first couple movies) I'd say.",1

"Best production ever I give this album 5 stars and here's why: every track on the album is GREAT, it really has work put into each of them and the production and Gaga's vocals are stunning! Just listening this in car with a stereo system amazed me, headphones and 5.1 sound system also gives that great vibe.<br /><br />Make sure you don't listen to it on crappy laptop speakers, though. Unless, you've got really good ones. The lame ones really don't serve anything.<br /><br />My favorite tracks would probably be Aura, G.U.Y, Sexxx Dreams, Venus, Gypsy, Do What U Want, Dope, MANiCURE, Applause. That's a lot and I'd name the whole album because it's just that good! There are no fillers, so the album never gets boring. ( my opinion )<br /><br />I've mentioned Gaga's beautiful vocals already but  I just love how she actually experiments with her voice, and not only voice, production, yes I mentioned that too in the beginning, but it's everything! Fresh. This album is like fresh air.<br /><br />When I got this album and held it in my hands I noticed the foil album cover. I was surprises, it's just really wonderful!<br /><br />I could talk and talk  about this but I just can't express how perfect this is for me.<br /><br />Thank you Lady Gaga for creating such a great album.",1

"Zing! This book sucks. This novel is executed with all the panache of a faulty electric chair, which is a shame, because I really wanted to enjoy it.<br /><br />Dave Eggers insists on destroying the possibilities of this concept by flogging us with repetitive prose, literary cliches, cringeworthy metphors and wooden dialogue. The only convincing element was the readiness of the characters to blindly accept the initiatives of 'The Circle', which, given how devoid of personality they all were, is hardly surprising. Short of a man in a black cape, twiddling his moustache and cackling maniacally, this book was the dystopian equivalent of Wacky Races.<br /><br />It could have been just as terrible at half the length, but no, no. Why write a short bad book, when you could write a long one with twice the inflated ego? It's obvious that Eggers put minimal thought into the feasibility of his plot, for the second half, in particular. I am forced to conclude that the subsequent success of this book once more nods more to Eggers' prowess as an ideas man with a good business head. Because as a writer, he blows.",0

"Holy Cow/S***/Cr** - how very very dull! Ive just finished reading all 3 of the books by E L James, I was lured by the hype Im ashamed to say!! Last time I ever do that.<br /><br />Firstly, there appears to be a real divide of interest in the series; loved by many, hated by equally many. I cant say i hated them BUT, in a nutshell they are dull! Ok a little more background to that comment:<br /><br />The characters arent likeable enough, tormented enough, dark enough, kind enough, or anything enough for that matter. The story for want of a better word is so weak it doesnt hold true - yes its fiction but you want to believe in something dont you?? The sex is repetitive and not titilating enough I believe; sorry but thats how I feel. Its all very dull and samey. The reason I dont hate them exactly is that, just how I feel there isnt enough of anything it also made me feel ambivilent to the books too. Christian could have been made way more dark or controlling but wasnt so I couldnt hate him nor like him nor..anything! haha.<br /><br />If however you want a mindless, fluffy book that is a basic modern take on Mills and Boon then here you are!",0

The two films have excessive crosstalks all throughout the movies. This happens on almost every scene, especially when the charcters are in motion. This causes eyestrain and makes it unwatchable. I am wondering if these blu-rays are defective because all my other collection do play well.<br /><br />Since I bought these items for 3D contents, I am not happy about it.

"Disappointing The story was interesting- as was the way it was presented in two different narrations, however, when an author takes you through all the details of a crime and leads you to a point that you finally will get the satisfaction of a good ending, she leaves you standing with nothing.  I really got the feeling that she couldn't think of what to do and just ended the book....",0
"Lots of new ideas wasted by poor song writing. To starty positively I like the fact that this album sounds different to the work Prince has been producing previously. It sounds more futuristic. He uses layers of sounds, effects, synths etc. to create something that, at first, sounds quite new. There are some really interesting and enjoyable moments in lots of these songs, sadly, the songs and album, taken as a whole, don't add up to much. For all the ideas at work there is not much focus. The effect is a wall of sounds that lacks soul or the ability to evoke emotion. I get the idea that the music using more artifical techniques reflects the title and theme but the songs suffer badly. When you know that the Prince of old could write killer lyrics and just can't find any on the album it is disappointing. Once again, there are several bland ballads from the man who wrote The Beautiful Ones and Adore. The opening track is, to be honest, just annoying and I was tempted to even skip it. U Know and Clouds are better and, in my opinion, the two best songs. Way Back Home is decent whereas The Gold Standard sounds horribly out of date and was done so much better on past albums and the much undderated The Black Album in particular. The album is not a complete failure but the quality of song writing just isn't there anymore. This is also evident in the number of bland, generic rock tracks on PlectrumElectrum. Prince still sounds great, especially live, he just doesn't write very good songs anymore.",0

I have been enthralled all the way through the series , but this book did not quite have that feeling of not being able to put it down (even though I did finish the book in one day). I love the series and the book is well written , it just feels Cornwell is trying to stretch the series out a bit too much. I expect the next offering to be greatly improved.",0

Yes it's got big hair, bad hair, facial hair, Amy Adams fried eggs on constant show, Jennifer Lawrence, but that's it, all flash, very little substance, it's melodramatic, thinks it's far clever than it actually is, oh and rather dull to be honest (Lawrence's character Rosalyn blowing up the 'science oven' being one of the few memorable moments!)<br /><br />Talk about the Emperor's new clothes.",0

At the very least I do not expect the price to be more expensive than the hardback book - which obviously I will not buy and lug around in my handbag as this defeats the whole object of owning a Kindle.<br />Well done publishers - this book is now receiving a very low rating on Amazon without even being read - which I feel is unfair.",0

Delving into an unpopular area, and bringing to fore the attendant effects, Sandel tells us the issue isn't about money or market principles but extending them into spheres they do not belong thereby perverting the nature and purpose of human relations. yes, Sandel calls for public discussion to checkmate the trend but the trend has eaten so deep and seems so normal. How viable might that be? If you ask me, it's a must read. It gives you a break from the 'normal'.",1

GREAT Best game.<br />This game is great for staying in all day on a rainy day<br />If I were you I'd buy this app,1
"Good Light, motivational and very easy read.",1
"Would not recommend. I downloaded the app and at first the cam was upside down, although I shortly resolved this problem. The app uses cam coins and is very confusing, as I do not see why they are needed.<br />The one good thing about the app is the timer, which appears on screen.<br />The quality of the photos are absolutely diabolical and completely crap. The photos also flipped themselves over for no apparent reason after being take, she on screen the we're the right way? What is the point of it...?<br />I would not recommend this to anyone if I'm honest.",0

"Difficult one Bought on the strength of two 'magnificent' single releases.  For these two releases the band appears to have taken a different approach to their usual as the rest of the cd is 'not the same'. The remainder I assume is the 'norm' for the band, more of a raw country sound, not bad but not what I really expected.  I can only blame myself however for not doing the homework before purchasing.  Having said that however it's not terrible just different and they'll sell a lot more with these two tracks added rather than staying with the 'norm', in my opinion.",0
OK Not really brilliant. Got it as a free Amazon app that had speech to text facility.,0

"Tuneless drone Yeesh.  Why is there such a poor pattern with British bands?  As always, make two good albums and then lose the plot.  This album is notable for being \\""""harder\\"""" than the first two, but it is severely lacking in the tune department.  Alex Turner remains a great lyricist, but this album just underlines why literate lyrics are not all that crucial in making good music.   At least Be Here now, bloated and poorly produced as it is, gave us a handful of terrific tunes- Stand By Me, Do You Know What I Mean, My Big Mouth and Don't Go Away.  The best on here (Crying Lightning) doesn't approach any of the classics on the first two AM albums.",0

"Not The best transfer to Blu Ray, but does the job I've always wanted the Harry Potter collection and was waiting for Blu Ray, but I went the cheapest version and I think I may have been let down. The transfer of the first 5 movies basically looks to me as they have ripped this straight from DVD and placed it onto Blu Ray and tweaked the sound quality a little. The last two installments are what I expected for the whole series so it was quite a let down, I strongly advise for you Harry fans to invest in the higher priced collections before lowering the grade to this box set. Again no regrets though.",0
The best hard rock band for the last 10 years It`s the perfect cobination between american and england`s hard rock. This third album of BCC consolidadtes then as a band that meets the the perfection in composition an execution. Listen it from the top to the bottom. All tracks are great.,1
"So disappointed This book is so sadly misogynistic, I thought it was going to be different and new but it is truly depressing this was written by a woman. It's the oldest story in the world - women are crazy, vicious, irrational, vindictive and never to be trusted. Their emotions are crazy. Please don't read this book, it is terrible and by far the worst I have ever read. Gillian Flynn you should be ashamed of yourself every day.",0
Five Stars Wow great dvd,1
Three Stars have read better books on the theme,0

everyones favourite zombie-fest bought this after having been caught out by a fake on ebay and am never buying dvds from ebay again - when you think about the price and how much effort and money goes into making big-budget shows and paying the actors and crew its totally worth paying for.<br />hoping for more seasons!,1
Wrap your  arms around me Very different but quietly nice. Nice to hear Agnetha Faltskog is  singing again. Also I purchased &#34;Agnetha  A&#34; which was very pleasing,1
great book amazing This is a great book but I bought the book and when I started reading it on page 33 there was a big black splodge I could still read it just about. But it was a bit of a disappointment. But I'm sure this could just have been my book not yours. But I do highly recommend this book to you all!! Please read,1
It's ok It is ok but not what i thought it would be. I found helpful and interesting only the first chapters.,0
Two Stars NOT BAD .,0
The Magic I was not very happy with this book as I felt the book The Secret was brilliant. This is a added version based on The Secret. I would recommend you buy the book The Secret as this book will inspire you. The issue of having gratitude for what you have is based in The Secret you don't need another book based on gratitude. I found this publication to be a rip off for consumers when The Secret does the job. Plus I hate to be ripped off and this  publication gave me the impression that it was ripping off customers who had already purchased the first book The Secret. POOR POOR POOR !!!!!!!!,0

"A great repetitive yawnathon One of the great yawnathons of my reading life. I bought it for my wife who piled through this and Gone Girl on holiday and liked them. Whilst I enjoyed Gone Girl, I eventually gave up on this book. The plot is ridiculous, repetitive and I just felt like I had better things to do with my time.",0
Great range of music Chose the rating as I loved the music - good range from a number of different artists so very varied as well.,1
"Definitely not blown away but good debut A few catchy songs. But nothing too original here - very one-dimensional. Comparing him to the likes of David Gray is more than slightly ambitious. And how does this kid have such a vast well of sexual experience? Kind of strange and makes it awkward to listen to. However, I do enjoy his voice and I don't doubt that he'll get better and better as he gets older.",0
"Not as good as the first one Good film but like a lot of films the sequal is not as good as the first one, but still enjoyed it",0
slow Game is good enough but slow you lose your energy and have to wait a day for your energy to fill up. You will get about ten minutes game time per day.,0
Five Stars Best album I've purchased this year!,1
"Great Album - multiple songs which are brilliant Brilliant cd, nearly all of the tracks are great, so a wise choice to buy the album.",1
Five Stars It is truly amazing.,1
"Awesome new tracks, bad remixes This remix album from Michael Jackson, has remixed tracks from the HIStory album, with 5 new tracks.<br /><br />I don't like any of the remixes. I felt like they were worse than the originals, and are not worth listening to. For those who like dance tracks and clubs, you may like it, but I don't like hearing YOU ARE NOT ALONE in that way.<br /><br />The new tracks are good. This is It is a fast phased track that is my favorite of his album, and one of my favorite MJ songs. The chorus is magical. Blood on the dance floor is a dance track, where he uses a different voice at times, which is lovely.<br />Morphine is okay, I very much like the middle part. Ghost is also good, but Superfly sister is below average.<br /><br />A good remix album =D",0
"Worth buying for the first side I eagerly awaited this release after enjoying ELP's first album so much. Truth is, I didn't like it so much: first side excellent, second side patchy.  On buying the CD, I'm afraid that I felt the same, many years later.<br /><br />The major track - Tarkus - is excellent. An exercise in syncopation on the start of &#34;Eruption&#34; indicates that we are in for something really special.  I first heard `Tarkus' when they performed it live before the LP was issued.  It is a work that has continued to feature in Keith Emerson's live repertoire forty years later - I have seen him perform it with (reformed ) Nice and listened to a very good re-recording with his own band.<br /><br />I recently very much enjoyed the live version at the Barbican with full orchestra as part of the 'Three Fates' project. It lends itslef well to orchestration, which tells me that, as a composition, it is tour de force.  It remains a major part of ELP's repertoire and has stood the test of time.  It is worth buying this CD to hear this track, and if you like the others, consider that a bonus.<br /><br />The second side (as it then was) is a collection of more poppy material that I found lightweight compared to 'Tarkus' and the first album, finishing with a humorous track aimed at their engineer Eddie Offord.  Jeremy Bender has some excellent honky-tonk piano work.<br /><br />Recommended, for sure, but better was to come ...",0
Disappointed I regard Robert C as one if the foremost blues exponent of our time. Great guitarist wonderful voice I have all his albums but I am hard put to single out any track which makes time stop still.,0

Terrible Not great advice but i only know that now!! Tried some of the things she suggests with my first baby. With baby 2 and now baby 3 realise I put myself through all that rubbish with baby 1 for nothing!

I fear that if I had started with The Bat I would have missed out on the brilliance of the later books... The Redbreast, The Snowman, The Leopard etc.. I am still working my way through and will finish The Bat but unlike all the others it is very easy to put down. If you've read the others don't bother with The Bat but if you started with it don't be put off the later books are superb!",0

"Couldn't put this down I read this book in a day, I just could wait to read more.

"Great Album, Poor Sound 2003 Remaster I can't believe nobody has mentioned it yet on these reviews. We all know the album is a classic, brilliant music.<br />Anybody who has heard the Vinyl or previous 1994 remaster knows that this 2003 remaster sounds terrible! It has way too much treble and there is no slam/punch to the drums and bass. It sounds nothing like how this album sounded when it originally came out on Vinyl. If you love this album and care about good sound quality, do yourself a favour and buy either the 1994 remaster or UK Vinyl. You will see what i mean, this just sounds tinny.",0
"So much potential I really really wanted to love this book but i just couldn't. The story itself is great and I quite like the characters, two dimensional though they may be. My main problem is still the writing style, which i must admit i find quite annoying at times (every thought a character has doesn't have to be simplified. Credit your readers with at least a little bit of intelligence Ken!). I found the chapter on Spain quite annoying also as having grown up knowing quite a few members of the International Brigade, I know they weren't anywhere near as under the thumb of Stalin as the book suggests i.e. random executions of British IB members by an evil Russian officer ( I think there was only ever 1 British member executed, and even thats in doubt). Having said all that, i kept going with the book as i really did find the plot and characters interesting enough to stop me putting it down however, having a great interest in that time period may have influenced me. All in all, if your looking for something to challenge you or make you think, find something else but if your going on a long trip or down to the beach and need to pass the time, probably worth a go.",0
"Not what I expected It's good, but you will lose weight if you have smoked salmon for your breakfast, as one of the recipes suggest, because you couldn't afford to buy much else! As a type 2 diabetic I tried following the 600 calories recommendation and it had me feeling a bit unwell. The principle behind this diet is good, common sense - but a little more in-depth about diabetics would prove very helpful.<br /><br />I am still looking for the diet book where you can find all the ingredients at my local Tesco, until then you can adapt some of the ideas. I have kept to eating smaller meals more often, this will result in you breaking the 500/600 calorie limit, but combinred with a good walk everyday and keeping to about a 1000\1500 Calories I am losing weight.",0
"Sooooo damn good Brilliant ,heavy s*** from chuck and the boys best tracks,perilous nation and the title track and even the ballad is pretty good .love it",1
"More rock, less of the important stuff. The problem with the change from their old sound to In Silico's, is that they've left what remains of DnB in there. What you're left with is a collection of rock songs backed with some very basic (and as many have said, re-used) beats, preventing any track on here from breaching the standard of Hold your Colour.  The vocalist is another major problem, whilst he clearly has talent, he doesn't suit this band at all. Listen to Granite, the intro is absolutely brilliant, then as soon as the vocalist comes in you're tempted to skip the track. He just sounds so incredably bored with the music himself that he's not even going to bother.    This is the problem, if they'd never realised Hold your Colour, In Silico would be far more welcomed. But you can't just jump to an album which puts more emphasis on the rock parts, and less on the bass. It's the bass and beats which are the most important parts of most songs, and here they've just been casually added. I'm not even much of a DnB fan, but this was just a poor transition.",0
Five Stars Brilliant,1
VERY VERY FUN Love this game sometimes hard and sometimes easy😉😉😉😉,1
"Rich Dad by Mazen Rich Dad Poor Dad, is about setting yourself financially free. Roberts writing style gets you hooked that you would not want to put the book dow before you finish it.<br /><br />However, the book is motivational only, and it does nottell you how to do it, well other than by joining the Rich Dad club. Unfortunately the book is repetitive in the last 3 chapters (of 9), and it also full of promotionals of the Rich Dad products.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? I would.<br /><br />Is it a must read? Certainly not.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Mazen",0

"or at Law School There are literally tens of thousands of self-help books available for purchase on Amazon; successful people have never read them. Most are rather longer and more expensive versions of reading your Stars in the daily paper, where you should relax or perhaps try to please those higher-up than oneself. The advice in those books - very hand-me-down stuff - is, after the buzz it generates, forgotten within minutes.<br /><br />I read this book longer ago than I would care to remember and is the closest I have come to reading a self-help book. I was starting a small business myself and was looking for tips; I carefully read a page a day. The only parts I can recall, as is always the case with memory, are those pieces of advice which are seriously mistaken or ill-advised. The rest was unexceptionable and doubtless wise, but all the reading in the world will not make you an entrepeneur any more than it will make you a great athlete or a great lover. Despite the author's advice my project failed (within a few years); the author has now sadly left his corporate cubicle.",0

"Perfect for James Blunt Fans Well, what can I say. I bought this CD for my mum as a mothers day present because she personally loves James Blunt, so instead of buying the normal edition, I went for this one because of the extra songs. It is very good, as any CD you buy would be. It did come very fast as well though, but I did use Amazon Prime which influenced that.",1
"Oh dear To say I was disappointed with this CD is putting it midly. Happiness is one of my favourite CD's of all time, I play it regularly and never get bored with the music. So, being eager for more of Hurts I looked at Exile for quite a while, being concerned about the mediocre reviews, but decided to take the plunge. How bad can a Hurts album be, surely there must a lot of good stuff on there? But sadly there wasn't, the only two tracks I like are Blind and Help, which remind you of the talent of Happiness. I'm not sure what went wrong on this CD, it's not only the music that's disappointing but some of the lyrics are very old hat, it's as though the whole thing was rushed through without time to add their unique formula. So I probably won't listen to it much at all, but Happiness will still be a regular one for me, I just love it.",0
Hahaha What a great laugh this film is . Fairly enjoyed it . Can recommend,1

"Weird beyond weird If you are looking for later era Pink Floyd or Roger Water's look elsewhere because this is very experimental and more akin to Syd Barrett than Roger Waters,Ths album has regular instruments and body noises(whispers to farts) included which is something you do not get everyday.<br /><br />Amusing in parts annoying in others this album is an oddity that you will likely play once or twice and maybe let mates hear to show Roger Waters is not always very serious. It has a charm about it that  I can not explain, I suggest if its cheap buy it if you like Pink Floyd, but don't spend too much and be ready for something a bit mad.<br /><br />If you want Roger's solo stuff go for the box set of albums that will cover all you really need.",0

"Stevie Wonder hits the cabaret circuit. Ordinarily, i wouldn't do a review of this item. But i was very surprised to see it had been given two separate five-star ratings. Time to get the overall average down, in my opinion.    Check out the track listing on this live album, and you're going to think that it's something out of this world. It's simply jam-packed with loads of mega wonders. However, this is a live album from an artist who is well past his peak.

As a novice investor, this is very informative - gives great confidence and a thorough understanding of how to apply the author's principles.<br />The background history of patterns in financial markets is fascinating; arming the reader with an adequate knowledge of how the various bonds and stocks have behaved under particular circumstances.<br />'Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it' is indeed true. I feel success is assured once one proceeds with caution and this book placed firmly under the arm.",1

"worth reading Alan Bennett's \\""""The Uncommon Reader\\"""" tells a fictive story about how the queen, Elizabeth II, gets a passionate reader.She wasn't interested in reading before, but once she goes to a library bus in front of the palace and starts borrowing and reading books.In this story the queen undergoes a change from a conservative, serious and powerful character to a more open, less arrogant and passionate one.The author shows that by several humorous situations which I liked.The theme itself,\\""""reading is important and able to change a person\\"""",isn't such intersting.But the way how this change is described, that is the humor,makes the book easier to read.<br />Sometimes it is hard to understand for a non-British person, because the register differs from informal to formal.But I wouldn't say this book isn't worth reading.",0
"why so loud? this remastered album, of an album that never needed remastering is so loud it has ruined the sound of this album. Yes this is a great album, Black and White, heal the world, Jam, remember the time, i could go on. This came of cause after Bad, and although did not sell as many units, it was still a great album. I am very confused the reasons why this needed to be remastered and have the volume increased so it clips and you loose the quality of the original which I advise you keep. There are no extra tracks here as the CD was a very long anyway. Looking at both versions there is nothing extra in the booklet either its is just much louder, which it did not need, when I bought dangerous the first time around it was one of the best sounding albums crisp, and full of excitement, this version really has lost this which the original had. My advise stick with the original you can not improve on excellence. I was tempted to knock of another star just because Sony have ruined the album, if you want to know more on what i am going on Google loudness war and have a read. Black and white has got louder and louder, on every collection and then on this remaster it reached the pinnacle.The stars are for a poor remaster no the music, incidentally if you google loudness war this album and the track black and white has been used as an example of getting louder and louder, and ruining the quality.",0

"Innovative but raw Enter Shikari have a really innovative sound that i enjoy alot more than i thought i would. The rave sections in the song just seem to compliment the heavy sections and combine to make some of the heaviest riffs ive heard. ( outro on sorry your not a winner, intro to enter shikari, intro to ok time for plan b) the only thing that doesnt work for me is using the synths with the soft parts ( Adieu ). Enter Shikari have made it big already with the pop fans and nu-metal fans, and perhaps in the future will decide more on the direction of their sound and appeal to a wider range of fans.",0

"A slight step up from ed sheeran but......... Quote from ben howards biography;<br /><br />'Ben Howard is a young acoustic troubadour who will make you feel as though he is the first young acoustic troubadour you have ever heard. He brings freshness to the form, gives it lustre, making it all seem brand new even as his songs have about them a quality of wisdom and a rootsy authenticity as old as the hills'<br /><br />Did you write that ben? surely you had your tongue firmly in your cheek when doing so? something new and fresh? well - maybe for somebody totally without any musical culture (come to think of it, thats probably 70% of the population of the UK) that may well be. But for somebody like me, brought up on a rich and varied diet of folk and acoustic music - well, that blurb is a bit of an insult mate.<br /><br />Ok - id much rather people like yourself recording music like this than go down the olly murs-tiny tempah route which most young and brainless kids tend to go for these days. so hats off to you for that - but please, dont make this out to be anything more than what it is - I;E - a totally derivative mishmash of various acoustic artists going back over 50 years<br /><br />The songs? theyre alright i suppose. nice playing and nice sound from the guitar. Lyrics are rather vacuuos however, not saying much at all. No depth, no soul, no passion. Nothing to make you sit up and go 'wow' or root you to your seat like the giants of acoustic music do. The voice is that same affected, wispy, trembling, artsy thing that everybody from ed sheeran to coldplay uses. Its all a bit meek and harmless really, perfect for this middle of the road generation. it just sounds so......young, y'know? folk music for kiddies. oh dear. Good luck to you though ben",0

I maybe was expecting to much as the original really did have a great plot with twists & turns right up to the end but this seemed to meander to a pointless ending.<br /><br />Total Recall, Robocop, Alfie and the rest, maybe Hollywood is simply running out of ideas, making bad remakes so that we go out & buy the originals to remind us why they were good in the first place.",0

"the first chapter fooled me And the reviews too are very misleading. I was completely fooled into thinking that over 1900 5-stars and close to 900 4-starts can't be very wrong. Then after the first couple of chapters, which I could completely identify with and which was pretty well written too, I had my expectations set quite high. Unfortunately disappointment followed.<br />The platitudes from Elizabeth were quite annoying. And the stupidity! To deliberately fall off a staircase and break a leg in order to create a situation that will help a couple find each other, two people who actually do have a natural fancy for each other anyway and are both single and lonely, is as unnecessary as stupid. To do it to someone else's leg, tripping her on a staircase, is not only stupid and unnecessary but also cruel. How am I supposed to sympathise with such characters?<br />And the dialogues! Honestly I was several times reminded of the romantic novels I experimented with writing between the ages of 15 and 18. And even at the time on re -reading my own work I did realise they were rubbish. Maybe I should have kept them and now I could make a living from publishing books with titles like &#34;Hold me tight &#34; and &#34;never let me go&#34;. Yes that's another thing. Had I just bothered to look up the writer's bibliography, looking at the titles might have given me a clue that I was waisting my money.",0

"Post-apocalypse Dan Brown There are certain things that make a novel: Credible plot, convincing characters, interesting narrative and dialogue, well-planned choreography and of course careful attention to detail. Even if its plot is lacking in imagination, a novel can still be carried if the actual writing is done well.<br /><br />In spite of its quite promising beginning, Wool fails badly on all counts.<br /><br />There is essentially only one character: Juliette (who for some reason is referred to on the cover of the book as `Jules'), the remainder of the cast being largely forgettable. And even Juliette does not convince. She is introduced to the reader as a principled, no-nonsense person with a special talent for fixing things. She's quite likable but unfortunately, in order to spice up an otherwise boring and at times childish plot she is required to morph into a superwoman who can accomplish astonishing feats of endurance under water. Main character rating 4/10.<br /><br />The reader does not get much of an insight into the other characters. Mostly they are introduced, given a bit of action, then die a painful and/or violent death. Support character rating 2/10 (generous).<br /><br />The plot, based in a post-apocalypse world and featuring a group of survivors who have lived for generations inside a huge underground silo, has plenty of potential but gradually unravels into rather absurd comic book action played out by cardboard heroes and villains. The dialogue is mostly terrible (occasionally interesting or funny),  choreography poorly executed, the narrative wooden and regularly bogged down in tedious and irrelevant detail. And in spite of the obsession with detail, some of it is utterly implausible, defying all-known physical laws and in some cases just outright silly.<br /><br />The plot can be summed up as the good guys win,  albeit rather preposterously. 2/10.  Narrative 2/10 Dialogue 3/10 Choreography 3/10.<br /><br />Our heroine, having cheated death to cross the toxic wasteland of the earth's surface, arrives at an abandoned silo and manages to break in. She sluices the toxins from her suit with the festering contents of a saucepan found in a canteen. Decaying bodies are everywhere, giving rise to the impression that whatever disaster overtook the occupants of the silo, it was relatively recent.<br /><br />But later Juliette finds a survivor and we learn he has lived alone for three decades. Unfortunately, the author didn't seem to have grasped that neither bodies nor the contents of saucepans don't actually decay in an oxygenated temperate environment for periods spanning multiples of decades.<br /><br />Later still, Juliette finds more survivors, this time a group of children (whose origins are not explained), who have a surprising grasp of language considering there are zero opportunities to converse.<br /><br />Then there is the diving episode to rewire a pump hundreds of metres under water, that required our heroine to possess superhuman attributes of endurance.<br /><br />These annoying contradictions in detail and accompanying casual flaunting of human physiological constraints are too frequent and too glaring for the reader to easily gloss over. Plausibility 1/10<br /><br />With a bit more time spent in the development of characters, better attention to detail, tighter editing (could have shed 150+ pages without them being missed) and some rejigging of the plot, this could have been a fairly decent novel. But sadly, those things didn't happen.<br />Hard to give a writer only 1 star but any more would be overly generous. I really struggled to finish this book.",0

RJDs words and melodies are just wonderful and Cozys drumming is a revelation,add the rumbling bass of Jimmy Bain and keyboard whizz kid Tony Carey, and you end up with the best Rainbow album of them all. The album is defined by the track Stargazer, about building a tower of stone with our flesh and bones,just to see him fly, so many died, a magnificent tale of toil and suffering,beautifully described in the soaring vocal masterclass supplied by the untouchable, unreachable, and now  lamentably late, Ronnie James Dio.<br />Buy this ,and revel in it`s beauty and power, there`s not much out there in nearly forty years that can match,or surpass, this awesome band at the pinnacle of their collective endeavours,",1

These are not the original broadcast versions of the specials - the end credits have been changed to the style used in series 1-3.    What bothers me is that this change has been carelessly done. Only 4 of the 5 episodes have the new credits, Planet of the Dead still has the broadcast version of the credits - did they forget to change it?    The large metallic \\""""To Be Continued\\"""" has been removed from End of Time part 1.    The theme tune at the end of The Next Doctor has been poorly re-edited to accomodate the new longer credits (sounds like a record skipping) and David Tennant is now incorrectly credited on this episode as Doctor Who (as opposed to the Doctor).

However the two single releases are terrible. I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and Roll band sounds as corny as the title suggests despite a reasonable guitar riff from John Lodge,and Isn't Life Strange is just the most dire song imaginable, although I can't even comment on For my Lady and New Horizons except to say that they were the forerunners of the flimsy material to follow from this once great band. It gives me no pleasure at all to criticise them,being the first band I ever loved as a tender teenager but the dissapointment of their demise still haunts me to this day.

"Way off target - must try harder I'm not sure if I would feel comfortable giving these opinions to a child - certainly not if they are to be taken as scientific facts. Dawkins' early attempt to define reality falls woefully short of modern requirements. His viewpoint is dangerously narrow in this respect, perhaps in an attempt to keep the text understandable to children. It appears there is no longer any debate about the experience called Life - philosophy no longer exists or holds any merit when it comes to defining reality - life is simply fives senses doing their 'thing'.  Then, when i thought enough damage had already been done, Dawkins hits us with his three definitions of 'magic': fairytale magic, stage magic and something which Dawkins' calls 'poetic magic'. I would have expected at least a mention of ceremonial magic but it appears Dawkins has never heard of this. He would rather talk about frogs and princes. He would rather tell us that the reason we occasionally are moved by music is because of 'poetic magic' (no science involved here).  That is as far as I could read. If i am going to read magical fiction I will stick to Tolkien. I appreciate Dawkins sharing his world-view but i was expecting something a little more down-to-earth and factual. The first two chapters certainly appear to hide more than they expose.",0

"This movie is truly bad. I'm going to make this short and simple. The people who created this movie had no love or understanding for Tekken and it's characters at all. The film is shallow, generic and worst of all the characters are very poorly represented. Jin looks and acts like a little wimp, Kazuya is just a regular evil guy, who uses weapons to fight and Heihachi is just an old man who can't fight at all. Many of the important characters to the Tekken franchise aren't even there at all (Paul, King, Ling and Lei).    This movie will surely disappoint anyone who is looking for a good movie. Even fans will not enjoy this one. The people who gave it 4 or 5 starts are truly biased and don't know what the hell they're talking about.    Do NOT buy it!",0
"good film Directed by James Wan (Insidious, Saw, Dead Silence), The Conjuring is set in America during the 1960's. We follow the 'real' case-files of paranormal investigators The Warrens, who work against supernatural elements trying to possess the living, in this case the Perron family. The Warrens face a terrifying battle against a demon unwilling to leave...<br /><br />One thing you can expect from a James Wan film is quality, with an impressive collection of horror titles behind him, disappointment was never an option. Unlike many supernatural films of late (Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters) this film presents a nostalgic era before technology ruled the home roost (and the horror film), when a lonesome haunted house out in the sticks, and a creative eye for fear could hold the audience. The film creates a haunting atmosphere set around childhood themes; using games, toys and innocence to project the violence of this sinister entity. The POV of both families fighting 'evil' offers a variety of encounters and experiences, in a film that may have been less engaging otherwise. Although there is the usual line- up of jumps, Wan includes his own touch of originality making you leave your seat a few times.<br /><br />The reveal is always a tense moment in a ghost film, The Conjuring manages to keep it together unlike many others (Mama). However, the reveal always seems a needless element, as the presence of the ghost is enough to create the fear, and putting a face to a ghost is unnecessary. The solid acting of the cast should be noted, along with a well written script with moments of comic relief, but don't get too comfy, as Wan will pack a punch to those unsuspecting. An example of how ghost films should be; packed full of jumps, and minus the showcase of evolving technology that captures 'found' footage.",1

"Deluded Richard Richard, why didn't you call it &#34;does god have feet?&#34; because an awful lot of Christians think he/she/ it does. Instead you upset an awful lot of people who would perhaps have read your book and been enlightened. You seem to go around the place annoying people because you set out with your own pre-conceptions of this and that. This is biased research and investigation and I don't like the majority of your work. Your even quoted in my Artificial Intelligence book about 'what is life' and so on. Grrrrr Richard! x Jes",0

"Time For Something Different... Maybe Not... After three albums of varying degrees of quality, 'Trouble'-amazing, 'Till The Sun Turns Black'-not so good and 'Gossip In The Grain'-a bit more like it, fourth time around Ray LaMontagne brings in his touring band to ably back him up, and instead of the tried & trusted hands of Ethan Johns, opts to produce 'God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise' himself. So time for something different then.... or not, as it turns out. It quickly settles into familiar territory. The lack of an obvious lead-off single like 'You Are The Best Thing' or 'Three More Days' does give 'God Willin'...' a more balanced feel. There is nothing at all wrong with this album, he's in great voice and the standard of songwriting is as you'd expect, very high. Overall it's very low-key and an easy listen, but certainly no classic.",0

Three Stars Average,0
"Unnecessarily complex. Inaccessible to the average reader. When I first heard about this book from a colleague at work, who endorsed it wholeheartedly, I ordered it the very next day. Unfortunately, my expectations were dashed within the first 15 minutes of reading. I actually stopped reading after an hour and simply skimmed through the remaining chapters looking for some useful sections.    The writing style is so dry and technocratic, and the pyramid approach so complex, that it became rapidly clear that it is inaccessible to the average reader, who is simply not going to have the discipline to read, re-read and put into practice such consciously difficult stuff. No doubt some people can - after all, the book's a success - but it's definitely not your everyday business person.    There are many other much simpler and more mainstream-market accessible books which can teach you the ABCs of proper communication.     Michael Gentle",0

"I really wanted to love it - but the problem was... ...I am a big Harry Potter fan.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting wizards and magical creatures, admittedly, but I was hoping for the two ingredients in my most-loved books that had become synonymous for me with Rowling:<br /><br />1. Interesting, engaging characters<br />2. Moral questions and think-pieces<br /><br />This book could have had these 'magical' elements and been fantastic. The unfortunate girl whose circumstance is really against her. The sensitive social-worker trying against all odds to make things better for other people. Even the 'vacancy' himself.<br /><br />The characters just had... Nothing about them. I wasn't rooting for them. And characters don't need to be 'good' for this, I love reading about all sorts of bad - Hannibal Lecter, Lisbeth Salander, Cersei Lannister. But in truth, I just didn't case about this lot, or their motivations.<br /><br />Perhaps the plot was in mind before the characters were? Maybe if the characters had been fully-formed the plot would come naturally and I would have been hooked?<br /><br />I wish there had been some moral thinking points... I loved the message of 'what is right over what is easy' in the Potter books and was hoping for something here. Again, there just wasn't anything for me. I didn't finish the book feeling any different about society, or really feeling anything for Pagford or it's inhabitants.<br /><br />Maybe I was looking for too much. Maybe there was a message I missed? Maybe I got my hopes up too much?<br /><br />I'd say give this book a go and see what you think. Just don't have any expectations.",0
"Good content, average quality My sister used to be a Kiss fan in the early 80s but I also liked them. When I saw that the whole story got released on DVDs I became curious to get to know the true story because I received just information fragments from the media through the years.<br /><br />The content itself is rich, it contains 4 full concerts and several brilliant moments of Ace Frehley. Unfortunately the sound engineers did not care too much about the sound. Though the disks contain DD 5.1 and DTS tracks they are not really good quality surround materials. Obviosuly there were no remixing or remastering done. While the sound quality of the Reunion Tour is acceptable the quality of the Phycho Circus tour is rather poor.<br /><br />It is worth to buy this product for the content but do not expect the Kiss will play in your living room!",0

"Now the hype has died down a bit... ...it's time to take another look at the book.<br /><br />The things that still upset me the most about the last book in the series is that firstly, compared to the first five books, it's so poor, and secondly, the character assassination. The Snape, Harry, Hermione, Lupin and Tonks would never behave in the shallow, nasty way they were portrayed to in DH. I never liked the idea of Snape-loved-Lily and hoped so much JKR would not take this cliche route, not least to have it as the SOLE reason Snape was a 'good guy'. Let's face it, he really believed in blood superiority for every other person but some girl he had a crush on. Regardless of cruel upbringing, that's just not a nice trait. He was always vindictive, spiteful and bitter rather than a complex anti-hero who made the right decision in spite of suffering.<br /><br />Lupin, a good, brave, caring character, suddenly chooses to abandon his wife and child. The whole relationship set-up was shoddy anyway, making the strong Tonks into a clingy, moping waif. Like many other Harry Potter relationships, it seemed based more on lust (or resignation in Lupin's view, perhaps) than genuine love.<br /><br />Hermione's potential is wasted on a boy who's mocked and misunderstood her the whole series, and in a job she previously thought unworthy of her. Talk about lowering one's ambitions. If JKR was insistant on pushing the relationships, they should have been made realistic and the partners made equal. Instead Ron becomes a whiny, spoilt child who encourages Harry to seduce his sister, and Ginny, after 'giving herself as a birthday present to Harry' (you couldn't make this up...oh. Wait.), vanishes from the story almost entirely. Given the Weasleys are apparently JKR's favourite characters, many of their reoccuring characters at the last read as so flat, impetuous, needlessly nasty and unpleasant that it's near-impossible to like them. Percy might get redeemed, but the 180 flip his character does in order to do so is almsot as annoying as if he'd turned out to be evil. Molly is a murdering harridan. The only vaguely likeable Weasleys either barely appear or pointlessly die.<br /><br />Gratuitous torture and deaths (don't tell me Hedwig's death 'represented Harry entering adult life' or some such nonsense, and as for Fred...name out of a hat, much?), Unforgiveables being fine when the good guys use them (Harry? Molly? Oh, it's OK for them!), unresolved plotlines (Scrimgeour? What was the point there? The Veil? Fawkes?), historical comparison and metaphor carried FAR too far, the strange and frankly unnecessary epilogue which obviously covered so little of what was intended that JKR has to keep issuing further information regarding the characters' futures (so much for leaving something to the imagination), chapters of pointless exposition and leaps of illogical madness: such is the end to the series.<br /><br />Admittedly the Harry Potter series was intended as a children's series, but many of the earlier books involved such interesting charcaters and plots that adults enjoyed them too. To be so let down in the final chapters is disappointing and irritating, when it could have been so much better. I have genuinely read better fanfic than this. Perhaps the saddest thing of all is that there the size of the book could have covered all the things that needed to be covered. It just didn't.<br /><br />Not that there weren't a couple of good points, in a way. Neville was good, and gained some development and heroism. 'Potterwatch' was cute. Narcissa Malfoy, interestingly, was about the only character I personally came out of the book with any respect or liking for. The wedding was sweet, and Fleur and Bill a likeable couple...but these were just too few and far between.<br /><br />Ah well, it was good while it lasted...until book 5, perhaps.turned out to be evil.

"Me before You by JoJo Moyes WOW, This book was recommended to me and I wasn't disappointed, What a brilliant story I took the book on holiday and couldn't put it down.  The author has done a great job I was captivated, The book was very funny in parts and sad in others. It is a very long time since I have cried over a book but I did with this one.",1
"A dissapointing end to a series with such promise When I began reading the first book of this series I was immediately intrigued by the story, particularly with the concepts of vampires and werewolves being rival, and naturally enough with the love story between Edward and Bella.     Before I begin critiquing this book, let me say that at 15 or 16 I would have loved this book. It has all the agonised brooding romance that a teenage girl identifies with and longs for. The character of Edward, a tortured, handsome vampire struggling with (literally) his inner demons, while being passionately devoted to the romantic heroine (a human girl) would have made me swoon.    Sadly, I find that the author spent a great deal of time telling us how gorgeous he was, and very little time expanding the dimensions of her characters. Bella Swan has to be one of the worst heroines romantic or otherwise that I have ever encountered. She seems to be almost entirely defined by her obsessive love of Edward, and fails to develop any other notable personality traits throughout the series. Her one and only 'flaw' is that she is slightly clumsy. She is endlessly agonising over why oh why this noble Adonis loves her, and frankly so does the reader.     This novel has all the feel of a teenage girl constructing her own idealised romance, where an astonishingly divine man falls madly in love with her a profoundly average girl, and shows her just how beautiful she really is.When Bella is sassy (the diving incident) she comes across as unhinged, when she is tortured you merely want to smack her.    For those of you who had no such qualms with Bella in the first novel, you will probably enjoy the rest of the series. If you didnt like Bella, or were hoping the characters were somewhat fleshed out, you will be sadly dissapointed.    Also though I do not wish to spoil the novel for those who have not read it, I must say I found the ending both bizarre and anti-climactic.  I like fantasy, I like Science fiction, so using my imagination is not difficultfor me, however it can only be stretched so far beyond the realms of logic.    In short, it is ideal for Teenage girls, or those who enjoy popcorn-variety vampire romances in general with little depth or character study. For those who are merely intrigued by the idea, I recommend waiting for the movie, at least you don't have to bear with pages of Bella's inner monologue about Edward's ivory chiselled abs and facial features.",0
"THE MIDDLE GROUND The middle ground reviews for Fall of Giants appears to be a place inhabited by very few reviewers. Based upon the disparity in stars issued it would appear that this is a book you either love or hate. Personally, it looks like I fall into the category of \\""""it was okay\\"""" I found things in the book that were appealing and informative while certain plot line and continuity aspects of the story were not up to Mr. Follett's previously high standards.<br /><br />On the plus side, the historical aspects of the novel, i.e. WW1 and its outcome, the fight for women's rights, the rise of unions, the Russian Revolution, the formation of the League of Nations, and the interaction of historical figures, etc. were enlightening and made me want to delve further into this part of history by doing my own research. The book also illustrates the absolute absurdity of war, the general incompetence of many of those in charge and graphically makes plain the fact that nothing has really changed in almost 100 years. The entire outcome of any war ultimately ends up being decided by politicians who have never set foot on a battlefield and who, like jockeys in a horserace, try to out-maneuver their opponent, negotiate concessions, and form alliances that will ensure their position in the world picture. Additionally, the imagery Mr. Follett is able to conjure with his descriptive depiction of Welsh coal mines, English manor houses, and body strewn battlefields actually carries you away to that time and place.......a flair few authors possess.<br /><br />As for the negative aspects, my chief complaints are as follows: Most of the non-historical characters created by Mr. Follett are rudimentary and as flat as a cardboard cut-out. They are predictably, bad or good, heroic or pompous, innately intelligent or downright stupid. Another complaint is that there are so many characters occupying these pages that one almost needs a score card to keep track of the players. Finally, several of the romantic liaisons and their aftermath were elementary and foreseeable, and the dialog in the love scenes came across as overwrought and laughably trashy rather than wistful and endearing.<br /><br />This is definitely not War and Peace. Think of it more as Herman Wouk meets Margaret Mitchell. If overblown panoramic sagas are your cup of tea then put on the kettle and pick up your copy of The Fall of Giants.iaisons and their aftermath were elementary and foreseeable, and the dialog in the love scenes came across as overwrought and laughably trashy rather than wistful and endearing.<br /><br />This is definitely not War and Peace.

"Disappointing new sound I love the old Mumford and Son but this is soft rock at its worst, the energy from the old albums - banjo's, droms has gone the new sound is just a disappointment and not for me.",0
"A Solid Debut Asia are a curious supergroup, with their roots firmly entrenched in Progressive Rock, boasting members who derive from progressive mainstays, such as Yes, King Crimson and Emerson Lake & Palmer. However, their approach is appreciably dissimilar. Asia's sound is probably best classified as Arena Rock, defined notably by an intrinsic accessibility, prompted by their mostly concise song structures, and the clean, produced vocals of John Wetton. <br /> <br />Elements of the individual band members' progressive leanings are traceable here, on their eponymous debut, with the keyboards, in particular, reminding me of Yes, during their most productive 1970s period. The guitar work is also invariably impeccable, considering Yes maestro, Steve Howe, is the man behind the six-string.   <br /> <br />Despite this, nearly all the songs on this album are hook-laden, sing-along affairs, lacking any legitimate lyrical or thematic depth, but remain great fun nonetheless. That's the appeal of Asia for me: they present music which requires little mental exertion to enjoy, and which can consequently act as an apposite antidote for progressive rock fans, who may occasionally require music that is less taxing and more immediate than their customary favourites.  <br /> <br />The main flaw of this album, I feel, is its debilitating lack of variety. Whilst 'Heat of the Moment', 'Sole Survivor' and 'Wildest Dreams' are paradigms of arena rock, the other tracks have little else to offer. Still, there is no perceptibly poor track; they just seem to merge into a big, redundant mishmash of samey, polished rock. This certainly doesn't render the album utterly inadequate, as it can still be relished in moderation, however, ideally, Asia would have been well advised to eliminate this stylistic dearth before releasing the album.   <br /> <br />Also, from a completely personal standpoint, I feel that the vocals are a little too refined. This can lead to a sense of needless overproduction and, resultantly, the vocals and the music can appear somewhat detached and incongruous at times. <br /> <br />Overall, though, this is a solid debut from Asia, and a decent album for those who simply crave an occasional, mindless rock-out, accompanied by music that is fun, yet remains technically impressive. <br />",0

"depends on your age I have to agree that the writing is not very engaging and she does tend to list a load of products and designers etc, so it tends to read as though she's just noting down products that pop into her head...BUT I also think that this is a good book, for maybe teenagers or perhaps older, who don't happen to have many female friends to share tips with, or who don't know where to get the perfect pair of faded jeans on the highstreet. Also, not everyone has lots of money to try all these products, so someone that has, and who is obviously addicted to cosmetics, has pinpointed the ones she finds the best so has taken out the guess work for you. I think it's perhaps a bit patronizing in places and so the people that are likely to read this book, know their stuff anyway, but if you're a tad clueless like me, it's an OK read.",0

"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Disregarded the Subtitles DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DEAF OR PARTIALLY DEAF AND NEED SUBTITLES!<br />When I originally wrote this review, I gave it four stars. I have since decided to mark it down.I bought this DVD because I am writing about how literary texts and films from the 1960s treated the Cold War. As such, I needed to be able to quote directly from the film, and so intended to use the subtitles as an aid. When I put these on to watch particular scenes, I realised that the subtitles were only giving a partial account of what characters were saying. Given that there are deaf or partially deaf people out there, I think it's disgraceful that the subtitles do not accurately follow the script, because it means they are only getting part of the dialogue! Given that much of the film's comedy is created by the dialogue, deaf or partially deaf people are missing out on the nuances that make this such a great film but are still having to the same amount as everyone else! This to me seems wrong and grossly unfair. Why on Earth bother with subtitles if you're not going to follow the script accurately?!<br /><br />In spite of these criticisms, if you do not have difficulties with hearing then you will like this edition.The DVD is of excellent quality and has some interesting features. One of these are the staged interviews with Peter Sellers and the actor who played General Turgidson (I forget his name). There are also documentaries on Kubrick's background and how the film was made, which will be of interest for students as well as general viewers who are fans of Kubrick's works. In terms of the content, (with the exception of the subtitles) the only thing that disappointed me was that with it being the Collectors Edition I was hoping that the much-talked about deleted scenes of the cast having a pie fight in the War Room and the one with Strangelove's wandering hand would be on there. Does anyone know if these scenes survived and if so, where can I get them from?<br /><br />It seems a shame to mark down Strangelove because it is one of my favourite films and is a much-required addition to any self-respecting DVD Collection. I just don't think it would be suitable for people with hearing difficulties and so thought I would warn potential buyers.own Strangelove because it is one of my favourite films and is a much-required addition to any self-respecting DVD Collection.

That&#x27;s not meant to put you off - Rufus&#x27; voice is gorgeous and the opening song, Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk, is a piece of genius. <BR>The album deserves more than one listen - it&#x27;s not an immediate grabber but it&#x27;s definitely got potential as a grower.",0

"Better than the Movie Jodi Picoult has always been a favourite author of mine. The last book I read by her was `The Pact', but this book has moved up to my favourite spot. The style is as usual with Picoult, the reader hears from different perspectives and you can't help but keep turning the pages. The end of the book is amazing and very unexpected but it ties together perfectly. The movie with Cameron Diaz has an altered ending and I much prefer the original novel ending.",1

"Too Little Happiness I have heard Alice Munro described so often as one of the greatest contemporary short story writers that I had high expectations for this book. The length of the stories surprised me, together with her frequent tendency to ramble from what seems to be the main thread of each tale.  Then there is the tendency to skim in a few pages through decades of a character's life, often telling us what to make of people and situations, rather than implying or revealing these aspects.  Yet from the outset I thought I could see the reasons for Munro's fame in her easy, confident and very readable style, the rapid building up of situations and characters, the occasional very insightful comments which chime with one's own experience of life, clarifying some point which has lain dormant in one's own mind, and one suddenly recognises to be true.<br /><br />I was held by the continuous sense that a story is heading somewhere meaningful and thought provoking, and by the knowledge that, at any point, she may insert some dark and shocking event: a man murders his children in a jealous rage, a widow realises that the gas man she has admitted to her house is in fact a crazed killer. I suspect that most people will find that some stories leave them cold, but they are moved by a few to which they can particularly relate, such as a mother's sense of loss before steeling herself to accept that her son has \\""""dropped out\\"""" to become an anarchist.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who found the title story \\""""Too Much Happiness\\"""" hard to engage with  - it reads like a draft of a story, based on research notes - but I do not mind that it is \\""""out of character\\"""" with the rest in being the tale of a female Russian mathematician in the late nineteenth century, rather than a series of tales of small town Canadian life - a kind of Lake Woebegone with a sting in the tale. Also, the title seems inappropriate for the collection as a whole, since most of the themes are somewhat bleak.<br /><br />Although these stories are admirable and original, characters appear implausible at times and  plots often seem very slight with underwhelming downbeat endings(as in Wenlock Edge) and left me  ambivalent - not sure what to make of some stories and wondering whether I had missed something! I suppose that the scope for debating what each one means adds interest - good for reading groups and so on! I was made very aware of Monro's age with many of these stories harking back to a distant youth, and reflecting on a whole lifetime (as in Face).  I plan to read some of her earlier work to see if the stories have a tighter structure and make more of an impact.and original, characters appear implausible at times and  plots often seem very slight with underwhelming downbeat endings(as in Wenlock Edge) and left me  ambivalent - not sure what to make of some stories and wondering whether I had missed something!

"Another modern view done to excess Why is it that the more famous the director the less he feels obligated to respect the composer? This is beautifully sung but as for the rest.... The costumes are extraordinary. A mixture of the Red Army Chorus, The Texas Cowboys Cheerleaders, the Moslem Brotherhood and Princess Anne in drag! They get odder still as the opera progresses. Add to that rolling backdrops from the Battle of Kursk,V2 rockets, modern factory shelving, scenes that seem to be deliberately photographed out of focus or in lighting extremes that make it very hard to make out what is meant to be on screen. All this in response to Verdi setting the story in Spain and Italy 250 years ago! Absolutely nothing fits together in any logical fashion. This is the wierdest and I have to say one of the most unsatisfactory Blu-ray discs I have come across to date. Mind you with the recent Flying Dutchman and Der Meistersinger there is some competition about for that description! I could not work out to whom such a production was aimed. Purchase with great caution, rent if possible. The problem is that such productions very much discourage speculative buying as you will either love or hate this and it is not on my list of re-watchable blu-ray discs. Such a shame as it is very well sung.",0
"Not for me, sadly I've given this a neutral rating because I'm afraid I couldn't finish it.<br /><br />Not because it was badly written or uninformative , just because I found the author a bit smug!<br /><br />Sure, he's acheived a lot, good for him, but I got a bit tired of hearing about it. This may well be because I am bitter about my own unsatisfying life, but I imagine if you read a book like this, it's because you are dissatisfied with your life!

"Good story, weighed down by slow paced first half \\""""A Woman of Substance\\"""", about Emma Harte's life, from poor kitchen maid to powerful business leader and matriarch, is a good story, but the book could have been shorter. Especially in the first half, it's weighed down by way too detailed desciptions of furniture and clothes that distract from the story, at least for those readers who don't share the author's passion for interior design and fashion. The pace picks up in the second half and the book kept my interest. With tighter plotting this might have been a four star book. 3+",0

"A small step in the right direction Because of the reviews and their last outing \\""""only by the night\\"""" I went in anticipating a poor album, I actually only bought it because I had an Amazon voucher given to me.  Although this is a million miles away from their first 2 albums in terms of quality, is actually not half bad.  To get my point across I compare this to the last album (which is really the only one it can compare to without being trashed) it doesn't reach any of the same heights with songs like \\""""closer\\"""" for instance but equally never reaches the lows of the last, its consistent throughout with each song being fairly good.  It lacks guitar riffs and is built around more how good Caleb's voice is, the result is although pretty week, a reasonably good listen.  That being said I still would only recommend this album if you get it very cheap/borrow it.  Conversely if you think that their last album is the best, you should definitely get this, and maybe if you want some reaffirmed faith that Kings of Leon are perhaps at least trying to get back on track then give it a shot.  This is not a poor album but as the inevitable comparison always goes back to their early days, it's just no where near as good.  Go in expecting nothing but fairly good music, nothing special, as that's all your gonna get, but given their last album, this for me is a step (albeit small) in the right direction.   2.5 stars.",0
"A brilliant book ‘Prague Fatale’ is probably my favourite Bernie Gunther title of the whole series. Many of the other reviewers have mentioned the fast pace and the dark and occasionally explosive atmosphere created. I particularly like the sarcastic, sardonic, style that Kerr gives his main character, and though I thought this was a little forced and overwrought in some of the earlier books it works perfectly here. Like all of the series, this book melds fact and fiction wonderfully and it can be enjoyed by itself or as a part of a whole.",1

"A disappointment Not rubbish. How could any Emmy Lou Harris album ever be, but be returning to producer Brian Ahern, she has effectively gone back to the sound if her 1976 album \\""""Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town\\"""", and that's one step too far back to the future. After the progressive nature of her last three albums, Emmylou has obviously decided she doesn't want her rock fans any more, and to say the same thing again,she's gone backwards.     Make no mistake though, this album is beautifully played and exquisitely sung (who would have expected anything else) but after a few listens, I can't remember any of the songs.    A huge disappointment, and if in any doubt buy \\""""Quarter Moon\\"""", it's fabulous.    They say there's ne progress in this kind of music, and here's the proof",0
"Entertaining speaker, very disappointing book Having seen Ken Robinson's talks on TED, I felt motivated to check out his book. I found what he had to say was both entertaining and inspirational, and I felt inclined to find out more.     Well, what of the book? I can suppose why many people gave it 4 and 5 stars. We all enjoy a good story. I do, and at first I did genuinely find the stories interesting and inspirational, but here the author uses a story to put forward even the smallest idea. By the time I was half way through I felt myself getting weary. The point itself seemed lost.  But there aren't just success stories. There are other kinds of stories, some of which really seem like digressions for the sake of a story, until at last it arrives on a wispy point, a brief bridge before, god help me, another story. I'm sorry to say there's little substance to this.    I loved hearing the Author speak on TED and in this book he describes speaking as his personal 'element', he explains that when you're in your 'element', time seems to slow down. This could explain how he got the bulk of this 288 page book's message in to a 20 minute talk.    If you are happy to read lots of stories about people finding their inspiration, get this book. If you are looking to be pointed toward finding your own inspiration, don't bother.",0
"By no means poor just lacks the pace and edge of the original I watched this out of curiosity being a big of a fan of the John Carpenter 80's original, this version is not a cut and dry re-make of that film but plugs the gap in the story from the initial Norwegian contact with the space craft right up to the ending which is where the first film starts from.<br /><br />Unusually the director has chosen to shoot on film (no problem there few complaints about the cinematography from me it's decent)<br />But this isn't just a straight prequel as the lead character of Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) does seem to take on a role that's not a million miles away from a female version of the Kurt Russell original. Some elements of the story whilst in keeping with the general vibe doesn't always tie up as well as it should do, for example in the first film the &#34;Thing&#34; only reveals itself when it has no choice, but here it seems a bit too keen to leap into action for the pleasure of viewers.<br /><br />Story wise it fills in the gaps in a way which is in most ways respectful to the original. Cast wise the lead character fits the expected role pretty well, Mary Winstead is quite good with her performance if a little predictable at times (which is a problem), the rest of the cast is competent but few stand out. Effects wise the first film was rather good for the time period and again here it's up to par, the real problem is that &#34;special Carpenter sauce&#34; that really pulled the 80's version into the viewer it immersed horror/sci fi fans mostly down to one very important part of film making &#34;tension&#34;. The first film had it in spades, including the simplistic but effective Carpenter soundtrack. Here whilst there are a few scary moments, the sense of despair and fight for survival never really comes into play, and that's one of the film's main problems.<br /><br />For fans of the original the concept of a prequel is quite a good one (not a good idea to clone the first movie scene by scene and remember the 80's version is a re-make of the older The Thing from Another World) but clearly there are moments here where bits of that film have been borrowed to try to beef up the production and bolster the impact. It doesn't really pull it off, but falls into that category or merely &#34;OK&#34; rather than terrible or amazing. Worth a watch for Thing fans, but we all know the 1981 version is the one you'll keep coming back to.on is a re-make of the older The Thing from Another World) but clearly there are moments here where bits of that film have been borrowed to try to beef up the production and bolster the impact.

"Dull, dull, dull This is a highly literary novel, beautifully written, beautifully characterised, but somehow, it is not an engaging read. The personae in which John Banville writes is a curmudgeon, a bore, given to archaisms in language and in thought. He has marooned himself in a seaside village where, as a child, he occupied a chalet with his warring parents, and got involved with a family which had rented a house nearby. Considerably richer and more worldly than his own, the family fascinated him as a boy.<br /><br /> The closing paragraphs reveal a tragedy which he witnessed towards the end of his holiday, but although it comes as a shock, it does nothing to enlighten the reader to events which preceded it. What flows from the tragedy is more of the dull-eyed, musing nostalgia which has gone before.<br /><br /> This novel won the Booker prize for 2005 - perhaps the judges were of a similar, melancholic, misanthropic disposition as that of the author?",0

Unfortunately, unlike The Help, which does so in a comedic way, there is nothing amusing about this book. The characters lead depressing lives, and the writing is equally flat and depressing. None of the characters ever achieve anything resembling three dimensionality and, ultimately, I found myself not caring.

"experiments from Esquared This book was beautifully written in an easy to understand and humorous style.  The 'experiments' were easy to implement and I worked on 8 of them.  I didn't have the coat hangers for that particular experiment.  I was a little disappointed with results, as the 48 hour time frame seemed to have no meaning whatsoever, and the desires I wanted, mostly didn't show up.  I think the book should have included a chapter on 'why the experiments fail sometimes'. Overall, it is a great book, very entertaining and fun to try the experiments",0

"The Many Lenses The most helpful part of this book is actually the beginning, where the author encourages you to just go and start making a game. \\""""Game design is not a set of principles, it is an activity.\\"""" A few pages after, the author defines \\""""listening\\"""" as the most important quality of a game designer. Being a professional game designer myself, I can't agree more. The author didn't help me to sharpen one particular skill, but he changed my perspective and I found it greatly helpful for my career.<br /><br />However, with more and more lenses being revealed, I found the content broad but shallow. You can easily find examples like this one: \\""""The Lens of Balance\\"""" - Does my game feel right? Why or why not? \\""""The Lens of Story\\"""" - How can my story be better? It's not constructive or helpful. It's just like you are having your game design reviewed by your lead, and the only feedback you got is \\""""make it better\\"""".<br /><br />The more I read the book, the more I feel the author tries very hard to find enough different principles to fill the 100 lenses. Naming them lenses also doesn't change the fact they are the principles that the author mentioned in the very beginning.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is it teaches you to have a wide view of your game design, to see it from as many different angles as possible. But also, it fails to reflect the harsh reality of making a video game, and almost every time you have to make the hard decision to ignore most lenses and only focus on the core experience you would like to deliver.<br /><br />One last thing worth mentioning is the book uses the game ICO as an example in explaining the indirect control. Although it doesn't change the point the author tries to make, but he made a mistake here. The game doesn't have a clever timer mechanic. The evil spirits' appearance is entirely scripted. If you are in a safe place, they wouldn't appear no matter how long you stay.

"Good value for Money. Always thought the doors were overated to be honest, I used to have all the albums when i was in my teens about 20 years ago, all the Pot Heads in school used to rave about them and i'm one of those people were if I buy 1 album by somebody I got to get the complete set (Not very good if you start getting into Bob Dylan and then decied you don't like it, lost count of how many albums he's done). Any way Always though that The Doors albums only had 2or 3 decent songs on each album (Same with Kiss, who are very overated in my oppinion but hey) and this set has confirmed that for me although I can't complain for the price. Love Peace Frog, Riders on the Storm, The End, Moonlight Drive and Whiskey Bar, maybe now i'm a bit older and with a few more listens I mite actually like alot more of their stuff, tended to open my mind up a bit more musically as i've got older. 9/10 for value,(Works out at about £3.40 per Disc plus you get a box to keep them in.WOW) 5/10 for music. If you love the Doors buy this, the albums are all the 40th anniversary remasters and sound pristine, John Densmores drums sound alot crisper to what I remember but sometimes Kriegers guitars are a bit quieter in the mix, particularly noticible on Break on through. As described it's all 6 studio albums in good quality mini replica card Lp sleeves (No Inner sleeves). No extra artwork only a naff 16 page booklet that just has pics of the album covers and credits for each album, no notes or interesting info or pics.",0

"Everyone's allowed their own opinion - I just don't like it! Technically one cannot fault this, the playing and production are excellent.<br />But...<br />I just don't like it.<br />One could compare it to going to a fine dining restaurant, excellent chefs and ingredients but despite all the accolades and awards, to my palatte it doesn't work.<br />The Raven is good, the Watchmaker starts fine but drifts into self indulgence. The rest are examples of why Prog Rock in the 70s was so derided, too clever by half. If ELP and most of King Crimson, the exception being In the Court of the Crimson King - a classic of the genre, are not to your taste then be careful of this one.<br />One of his teachers may sum it up as follows: Steven has produced some excellent work previously, see Insurgentes, In Absentia and Recordings, but seems to have lost his focus, perhaps through new friends that have led him astray. Can, should, do better.",0

"One of the worst films I have ever seen Like so many others I watched the originals as a stripling.  They were precious and dear to me.  Foolishly perhaps, I allowed myself to attend the screening of this film with much excitement.  I knew something was wrong quite early when Jones met the baddy.  The acting was staggeringly bad.  The lines were awful.  The bit with the fridge was possibly one of the better bits.  And wasn't there a CGI mammal?  And after that it got worse and worse.  Mutt Williams!  This was such a stupid, stupid idea.  And do you remember the scene in the quicksand where Marion 'revealed' that Mutt was Jones's son??  Such wooden acting, such execrable lines.  It was all so awful.  And the ridiculous use of CGI.  CGI has ruined many films but this is perhaps the worst example.  The 'exciting' battle in the forest was pathetic.  The fact that Mutt got a few shrubs slapped against his crotch was not amusing.  The alien component was neither surprising nor welcome.  It was deeply stupid and unimpressive.  Steven Spielberg has made some films that will be watched for generations.  Even in more recent times he has made films of which I am fond - such as Catch Me If You Can.  How can he had made something this awful?      After watching this film I held it all in for maybe 24 hours.  Then I wept profuse tears of sorrow.",0
a bit of fun Well it was fun but dont expect it to become one of my favourites I've used it twice. Maybe they will add more to it.,0
Great game Great game!!!!! Really addictive and really fun I highly recommend it to anyone,1
No that impressed I guess this is a bit like a movie that everyone has raved about and causes your expectations to be set really high only for you to be disappointed. For me this is a beautifully written book but I didn't find it particularly inspiring or spiritually enlightening. It really didn't do anything for me at all. Probably just me though.,0

"This book should help I didn't buy this book because I thought it applied to my parents but because I realised that it applied to my mother's parents (who seemed to fall into several of the categories in this book betweene them).  Not surprisingly this did compromise my mother's ability to be as good a parent as she very hard tried to be.  These legacies do not end easily.  Hopefully this book will give me insight into why my mother's parenting &#34;style&#34; was as it was.  I won't be able to discuss this with her as she died some year's ago, not that she would ever discuss them much as she felt too much criticism was being disloyal.  Pretty amazing given how awful they were as parents.",1

"Sherlock Complete Stories Being a huge Sherlock Holmes fan i was looking forward to having a book with all the stories for a decent price. This was the perfect buy! It’s very big, the letters are a little small and the pages are very thin (like the ones on the yellow pages), so it can be a little scary, but I can’t wait to read it all over again. Also the illustration is lovely! If you are a clumsy reader you should think about getting a more robust version. This came in a perfect state, although I had some issues with the delivery (they delivered the package in my neighbor’s house, but my address was correct!). I absolutely recommend it!",1

"Gorgeously written After reading Pandemonium which is the second instalment in the Delirium trilogy I had a new found respect for both Lena, and the series in general. This meant I also had high hopes for Requiem, and I prayed that the ending didn’t live up to the endless criticism I had seen on the internet.<br /><br />The book was gorgeously written, and the characters were portrayed perfectly to the point where they did feel like real people and you could feel their emotion oozing out of the page and into your heart. All except Hana. This was my first out of only 2 problems with this book, because it was written with a dual perspective from both Lena and Hana’s POVs. A dual perspective worked well in Pandemonium with Lena’s “then” and “now”, and I loved Lena whereas I simply don’t like Hana. I feel bad for admitting it but even when things were getting tough for her I couldn’t relate and didn’t have the slightest twinge of sympathy. Instead I kept thinking “that’s Karma bitch”.<br /><br />But now moving on to Requiem’s ending: it pains me to say this but I agree with the majority of the criticism towards it. It had a beautiful final chapter for a book, but a terrible final chapter for a series. There was no closure; you had to read between the lines just to see who lived through it! Never mind who Lena chose, and how people handled the devastating grief after a war (that you don’t even see conclude). I read an interview with Lauren Oliver where she says “I don’t believe in happy endings”, and while this is totally respectable, does it mean she couldn’t have one? No. Was it too much to ask for a pages worth of epilogue? No it wasn’t.<br /><br />The lead up was perfect with just enough tension, and it didn’t drag on to a point where you were bored or dreaded an anti-climax. The climax was all it lived up to be, it just fell short. Literally. IT WAS TOO SHORT!<br /><br />This is not the only reason Requiem doesn’t get 5 stars from me, because I cannot get over Hana being a frustrating (but necessary) character, nor a lack of ending.<br /><br />Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uke I cannot get over Hana being a frustrating (but necessary) character, nor a lack of ending.<br /><br />Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk",0

"I dont know who Muse are anymore It may sound harsh but if you listen very carefully you can practically hear the band crawl up their own bottoms. This is self indulgent twaddle. A James Bond theme, A 'Queen' tribute song, Apollo 440, 1990's Euro disco & George Michael. Yes, these are (in my opinion) some very strange influences on this album. No joke.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Muse, I saw them during their Resistance tour and in 2004 during T-in the Park. An amazing live band who up to 'Absolution' were top of their game, from then on it it's been a drip feed decline ending up with this new offering for 2012.<br /><br />Gone is the innovative ideas, lyrics and music compositions, replaced with a new funk/grove that does not suit them at all. Red Hot Chilli Peppers they are certainly not (or should they be). Muse & dub-step ??, just because you can, does not mean you should.<br /><br />I imagine Absolution era Muse would listen to this and be slightly perplexed as to how the transition happened, as have I. Also any band who has a tune on their album that resembles a George Michael track, should simply wonder why. Even the silly but slightly amusing instrument the track (Madness)is played on live doesn't make up for it. Is it rushed? Mybe trying to appease their record company too much by releasing an album every two/three years despite its quality? Who knows. When every track sound like they should be on different albums, you have a problem.<br /><br />Every now and again a band get so huge, they can practically do what they want. Muse are now at that point. How I miss Muse circa 'Plug In Baby'. Still, I imagine I'll be in a minority because they have become untouchable these days. I have listedned to 'The 2nd Law' twice now and it was even more dull on the 2nd listen. It's odds on that around 2017, four more albums in no doubts that they will look back at this album as a blip. Too much going on in their private lives, should have taken time off (blah blah blah).<br /><br />But that said, I'm sure the music will provide yet another backdrop for their huge OTT light show with flying saucers, aliens, dancing Chinese bears in denim jackets or whatever the heck they are thinking of doing this year.<br /><br />Good luck with it boys but I'm no longer taken in by it, or indeed interested.",0
"Great Movie I caught Sahara [2005] on TV recently and it is a great movie if you are mentally challenged or suffering from a tremendous hang-over. Matthew McConaughey is an all-American James Bond-Indiana Jones type adventurer in this mindless \\""""movie\\"""", and Cruz plays a Doctor/Scientist.<br /><br />Sahara is a poor movie; it's the type of movie that exists in that strange world where critics almost universally pan it, yet it still manages to pack 'em in at the box office.<br /><br />Despite adding nothing new to an already crowded genre, it's already earned its money back in the States and topped the charts. It seems the people love it and it has been tailor-made to appeal to the teenage girl crowd.<br /><br />Any action? Surely Cruz and McConaughey don't discuss science the entire time? There's a boat chase with numerous explosions, overturned trucks, endless rounds of ammunition, and a camel race straight from the classic movie 'Ishtar'. Nothing, however, could prepare us for the concluding scene where a military helicopter is taken out by a rusty 140-year-old cannon. I also liked what they called a \\""""Panama,\\"""" where a yacht is packed with explosives and let loose to, uh, explode. Me like fire. I've stopped speaking in full sentences now cos this movie has that brain-dead quality to it.",0

"Love game, keeps on crashing! I really enjoy playing this game, particularly now that the free mode has classic, zen and arcade modes. The basic principle is to swipe as much fruit as you can and avoid bombs.  In classic mode your aim is to not miss any fruit(or hit bombs) as missing 3 out of every 100 points you score will result in game over. Zen mode, which personally I find the least exciting or rewarding, involves swiping fruit in a time limit aiming to swipe 3 or more with one sweep in order to gain extra combo points.  My favourite mode however is arcade mode which is also timed and has the addition of 3 types of banana which freeze play, double your score or send a frenzy of fruit.  You also have the chance to gain extra points from combo blitzes.  The graphics are great and when you earn certain number of points you can unlock new backgrounds, blades etc.<br /><br />I would be giving it five stars if judging it on the game alone, however it frequently crashes which means I have just stopped playing it.  I have reinstalled it but the same problem persisted.",0

[] Graduation Well I was so impressed by Kanye West's first two albums that i just knew I had to get this album although now I'm beginning to wonder why!    I just can't take this album seriously its like every single (apart from 'stronger') was made in a kids music class by kids...

"Part coming-of-age growing up & part Hannibal Lecter dismemberment...delightful!! Perfectly pitched by Alice for today's hyper-sentimental audience, and a must have for Oprah fans most likely - this bizarre tale starts with the grizzly murder which leaves nothing to the imagination and then unfortunately for whodunit/thriller fans turns into a make-it-up-as-you-go ramble through just about anything not related to the murder in the town. It's a very Politically Correct formula and just asks you to absorb endless meaningless but high sounding aphorisms, similes, spiritual floating, questioning, ghostly voyeurism etc....it goes on and on - which must have left Alice breathless as to her own brilliance - but as to the killer, he plays less and less a part in the heart warming (!!) events after the girls dismemberment.

"James Blunt The song \\""""beautiful\\"""" is a decent enough song even if the repetitive nature of song can get annoying when it is overplayed, but the fact that is the best song on the album proves that this album is pretty average.But don&#x27;t take anything away from it, it&#x27;s worth a listen or two and the occasional listening after that. Some of the songs are diabolical and the lyrics can be meaningless. But it is certainly worth your money if you want some background music to any chore. Or if you are driving. Not powerful and certainly not inspiring, but better than most.",0
Annoying Not actually any music on most of them just Peppa´s quite annoying out of tune voice!!  Also isn´t separated by tracks so you can´t search for your favourite song and miss the rest without having to scan through the whole CD,0

Glad to hear they won't be using the same company again for any of the other seasons. That being said, I still enjoyed the chance to see season 2 in HD and all the live action shots still look cool. Really enjoyed watching the measure of a man extended cut.",0
"Pinball Wizard and a lot of fiddling about Maybe it's effective as a show and a story, but 'Tommy' as an album doesn't do it for me. It has conventional elements of opera in the 'Overture' and 'Underture' in compiling the rest of the work's musical themes. Otherwise, it is a series of largely forgettable songs. Set against 'The Who Sell Out' and 'Who's Next', the albums which precede and succeed it, you notice that the band seem somewhat restricted. The usual high standard of musicianship is there, but there seems to be an undercurrent of energy that rarely achieves total release. Apart from 'Pinball Wizard', only 'Go To The Mirror!' satisfies. Supposedly great songs such as 'Acid Queen' and 'I'm Free' are, in truth, mediocre. The Who can do slow or quiet songs, but they usually serve as a breather. Here, they take up much of the album. As for Roger Daltrey's 'See Me Feel Me' cameo, described by Pete Townshend as captivating in concert, I can only imagine that it takes on a visual dimension. Here, my reaction is 'big deal'. The crowning irony of all this is , of course, that The Pretty Things got there first with 'S.F. Sorrow', although their relatively limited popularity and talent meant that their album was consigned to obscurity. I love The Who's early singles and most of their 'conventional' albums prior to 'Who Are You', but I would warn anyone looking to delve into their catalogue for the first time to leave this well down the list.",0
"Nice Idea... Not quiet there though The idea is a sound one; have many artists pick a Gabriel track and re-record it in their own style.  In reality though the versions generally feel thrown together as if they were something each artist did in an afternoon as this project was 3 years behind schedule.  This works for some tracks, Paul Simon's take on 'Biko' with little more than a 12-string acoustic sands up well while other tracks are less interesting.",0

"A new low in plagiarised mediocrity Astonishing that a book that would compete for the most boring book ever published ever got into print.  Just goes to show publishers can take the biggest piece of garbage and hype it into a best seller.

"Santana Sidetracks I just wanted to put a slightly different view to the first reviewer. Whilst not top notch for Carlos,(did he ever reach the heights of his first 3 albums again?), this is far better than the one star awarded, which as far as I am concerned means worthless.<br /><br />This is only a 3CD set which means it os not such good value as the first two OAC boxes but there is still much here to enjoy. These were a bit of a sidetrack for the man, and I admit that there are religious connotations to these albums, but it's the music that counts. The most \\""""difficult\\"""" album so far as I am concerned is \\""""Illuminations\\"""" with the best without doubt \\""""Oneness: Silver Dreams Golden Reality\\"""" with the final track \\""""Song For Devadip\\"""" absolutely marvellous.<br /><br />For those of you who can't remember, Carlos became involved with Eastern religion/philosophy about the same time as John Mclaughlin - they both dressed in white for a while as a sign of purity, and John once expressed the view that \\""""music was the expression of the soul, and to create pure music, you must have a pure soul, and for a pure soul, you must have a pure body\\"""". (Hear them both together on [[ASIN:B0000A2I1C Love Devotion Surrender]] which is available in the budget box [[ASIN:B0018BF1D6 Original Album Classics Vol.1: Caravanserai/Love Devotion Surrender/Welcome/Borboletta/Amigos]].<br /><br />Whilst different, these albums are still 100% Carlos Santana exploring a new direction, and shouldn't all artists do that?",0

"Moderate Whilst the idea of blowing up all major credit card buildings to the sound of the Pixies classic Where Is My Mind? has a number of appealing elements for me, the near three hours leading up to this climactic sequence are of, at best, mixed quality.  Also, the idea of an entire story being in the mind of the main character is not particularly original (the equally unimpressive The Sixth Sense springs to mind).  Don't get me wrong, David Fincher's film does have some things going for it - Edward Norton puts in another sterling performance and even Helena Bonham Carter is actually quite engaging (not Brad Pitt, though).  The cinematography is also impressive, with the predominantly dark and dingy settings providing an appropriate backdrop for the (predictably) violent fight sequences.  Indeed, Tyler Durden's invective against all things corporate also provides a relatively original perpective for an (essentially mainstream) Hollywood film, albeit these ideas are not carried through effectively, and the film is at least an hour too long.  David Fincher is undoubtedly one of the more innovative and skilful directors at work in Hollywood currently, but it seems that for every Zodiac (excellent) and Seven (very good), he also comes unstuck with a The Social Network (mediocre) and this relatively modest (and, of course. massively overrated) effort.  The fact that he has also chosen to remake one of the 'Stieg Larsson films' also does not bode well, in terms of originality or creativity.",0
Happy Package arrived on time well packaged Bought as a gift for a female friend who simply loves Pharrel Williams.it is never off when I call to chat. I can simply say if your a Pharrell fan I would buy it or if you know someone who is a fan buy it...but if you want to keep a friendship I would have second thoughts lol joking a side it a great buy just to see a friend Happy...,1

Sorry but No idea what was going on.  Interestingly at my book club the room was split in 2 -those who loved and those who hated.  Obviously some people have worked out the story but I was not one of them.<br />Good luck with this one.,0
Escapade in Spain. it was a lovely story mainly for children but as an adult I thoroughly enjoyed it too I was so lucky I was able to find the film through Amazon nobody else had heard of it .  I saw it on early morning television.,1

Lovely book - shame about the paper quality inside I've received 2 copies of this book now (the B&N Leatherbound classic version) and both have had ripped up endpages where pages have seemingly stuck together and then pulled apart.

"Third time lucky? The score represents the third collaboration between Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan. Building on the excellent work presented in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, could this album possibly top the magnificence of the score for The Dark Knight - specifically the two-disc expanded edition?    Brooding, epic, grandiose and easily Zimmer's darkest score, what we have presented here is a series of suites that have been composed without viewing a single frame of the movie. Nolan has sliced, diced and manipulated to fit the images on screen. As a result, it's a largely unlistenable piece of work, saved only by the main recurrent theme which is heard a couple times through 11 tracks and takes up the final 12th track, 'Time.' It's this track that saves the album from drudgery.    Similar to Chevaliers de Sangreal from 'The Da Vinci Code' soundtrack, this is a haunting and beautiful track which builds to a stunning crescendo and makes the preceding, oppressive 45 minutes well worth the wait.    If you're a Zimmer completist you've probably already bought this album. If you're looking for a track that's reflective of the experience of watching Inception, I would buy the track 'Time,' and this should be everything you need.",0

Addictive Absolutely love this game. Only get a short amount of free time in a day so this game fits in really well. If I have half an hour spare I just blitz the researching until my energy runs out. Suites my time frames beautifully. Amazing graphics keeps me focusing on the important bits. Can be quite challenging but that's what keeps me hooked. It's a keeper.,1
"Epic conclusion to an epic series! I've been waiting to read the final instalment in the amazing series that is 'Kick Ass' for far too long now, so as soon as I could buy it I did hesitate. This is something I would recommend all fans of the series to do.<br />Mark Millar and John Romita Jr have brought the series to its conclusion, and what a fantastic read it was!<br />This series has never failed to entertain me from the outset, and will more than likely remain as my favourite series in the superhero genre. What Mark and John have done is redefine the genre in its own hilarious and twisted way, and sprouted one of the best stories I've had the pleasure of reading.<br />Simply put, it's fantastic!",1
A great series for Star Wars fans My son would give this 5 stars as he hasn't stopped watching the DVDs. A great series for Star Wars fans. Marked down due to the very poor condition of the DVD cases and box they were contained in -the plastic was all broken on the ends and the box was torn. I would have sent them back but my son wasn't letting me. saying that. the DVDs contained inside the broken plastic cases were fine.,0

"Inexplicably drawn-out. Loses any suspense. Unimaginative. *UPDATE* I've added two stars as I've since viewed 'Interstellar' which is twice as drawn-out.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Ugh! What were the TWO editors of this film doing?? -Aren't editors supposed to whittle down the boring and unnecessary scenes? Looks like they BOTH went awol.<br /><br />After 1H:45 the story finally drags itself out of a repetitious rut and develops towards its inevitable and predictable conclusion. The previous hour and a half could've been comfortably condensed into 10 minutes.<br /><br />I only watched this as it had 80% rating on Az Prime but it really is a mind-number. It's a shame, as the premise could be promising but it is not exploited very well at all. There isn't even any nudity to liven things up.<br /><br />..I saw [[ASIN:B00466HNG8 Soylent Green [Blu-ray] [1973] [US Import]]] the other day, from 1973, starring Charlton Heston. That was about Government and politics in a troubled future world. And in 90-odd minutes had more excitement, suspense and general entertainment than this drawn-out tosh. And some nudity to boot!<br /><br />I don't think it's fair to teenagers to call this 'Just another film for teenagers' as I'm sure many teenagers are watching more stimulating fodder.<br /><br />Pure drivel.<br /><br />OK, you can flame me now if it makes you feel better.",0

"Creative, funny and unexpected family gem When we went to the cinema to watch Paddington, I have to admit I wasn't expecting much - a treat for our daughter rather than a filmic experience for us all to enjoy. How utterly surprised I was. With a visual language comparable to Wes Anderson, a decidedly British wit (also much appreciated in the wonderful Box Trolls) and perfectly realised set-pieces, plus a notable voice performance from Ben Whishaw (so memorable as Pingu in Nathan Barley, so remarkably fragile in the recent, undervalued Lilting), this was actually a film first, a family film second. This will be a birthday gift much loved by our daughter, and I'll happily be watching it with her!",1
Five Stars Brilliant reading,1
frustrated Yes it is free but I do expect a certain level of game play love this app when it works right yet too many times do I get ''yur internet is down'' when it clearly isn't as my wife can still play internet games on her kindle wudda give this 5 stars cos the game is excellent when it does what it should,0
"this is the best price you can get it for Bought this book after watching the series. Very Impressed with it,this is the best price you can get it for! :-)",1
A WORTHWHILE BUY. I totally loved Howard Shore's score and the production for 'Fellowship of the Ring'. By comparison I was disappointed with the score and production for 'The Two Towers' and 'Return of the King'. But maybe that is because the following two are good but not excellent as I appreciated the first.,0
"Waste of time Total waste of time. Clice after cliche, after namedropping, after stupid joke. Flat boring story, annoying child characters, even more annoying city council characters. At least different chapters are told from different characters, so you can skip the boring and the bigger part of the book. Just watch the movie instead.",0
"hero of ages So much potential lay in this series and, with the exception of the first instalment, little of it worked for me.  For a start it was too long. 250 or so pages could have been shaved off this book, making at far less plodding and repetitive and a tad more concise (let us ignore the fact I think The Final Empire worked perfectly well as a standalone). Sections jumped in periods of weeks and, honestly, if it wasn't pointed out to me I would never have noticed. The characters thought and did the same things over and over and generally got on my nerves a bit with their introspection and indecision.  I read a review of this a while ago and the reviewer pointed out that all the characters sounded the same. I have to agree with that opinion. Sazed's (a Keeper of religion) dialogue didn't at all differ from Vin's (more a warrior) or Elend's (more a scholar) despite all three of them having such different characteristics and personalities on paper. And the characters in this third book just didn't match up to the ones in the first.  Another problem I had was the information given to us before each chapter. In The Final Empire, this information was given in diary format by Rashek before he became The Lord Ruler. This added to the story, eventually answering some of our questions along the way. In The Hero of Ages this information is written by an unknown author, although I did figure out who wrote it quite early on, who, unfortunately, gave the answers to questions we didn't know yet. This meant that I knew more than the characters did and reading about them making bad decisions and floundering around frustrated me and slowed the story down rather a lot.  On the flip side though, I still think Sanderson's creation of three unique magic systems is fascinating and I enjoyed finding out more about Allomancy, Feruchemy and Hemalurgy as the story unfolded.  I found this to be another disappointment after the joy of reading The Final Empire and I just don't know whether I'll continue with further instalments within this series.",0
Five Stars good,1

"Don't waste your time I had to stop reading this book after persevering for about 200 pages, because I just couldn't \\""""get into it\\"""". It was slow, dull and boring and didn't manage to draw in my interest at all. I didn't develop empathy for any of the characters and neither was I interested. For something that promises 500 pages of reading, most of it was packed with episodes from everyday life, where nothing much seemed to be happening. I found myself glazing over at times and having to re-read pages. The length could easily have been cut down considerably. By the time I abandoned reading the book, I couldn't care less what the other letters contained. I had picked the book up as the concept was good, but it was sadly let down by its execution.",0
Two Stars Not impressed.,0
"Irritating repetitive style, tiny type. The author has a habit of repeating points multiple times in several places in the book, reminding you that he's already mentioned something previously and letting you know that he's going to say something further on. He also makes lists of synonyms when describing something [listeners to BBC Radio 4's &#34;Just A Minute&#34; will find this familiar]. I found this annoying writing style really distracted from what he was trying to say, but I persisted all the way to page 525 nonetheless. The type is really quite small, which may be a problem for some.",0
Great graphics. This movie is a big set and proof of what nowadays computers can do with graphics.<br /><br />The rest is boring.<br />Marketing made its miracle again.,0
"5 stars A very well made game. I recommend this game to all sandbox game lovers and all gamers who love to fight mobs and bosses. Just recently Hardmode came out to android and tablets, before that update came out I started to get a bit bored of the game since I had defeated every easy mode boss.now you can battle a ton more bosses and get new items and a bunch more mobs.One or two days ago I defeated the destroyer for the second time and going on to fight the twins. If you Love multiplayer co-op then I highly recommend this to you. All-in-all its a great game and you should get it.

"All Filler, No Killer Firstly, I like Coldplay. Or more correctly I used to like them before Viva La Vida. Lets just say I'm glad I paid a quid less than a fiver for this one. It's OK, not absolute rubbish, but there are no stand out tracks and quite a few that, like volunteers for a job nobody wants, have taken a step back into the background. The notable tracks (Paradise and, er, let me think...) are only notable because of this. And, as others have said, awful mastering and production, even as MP3s!",0
"Garbage, fantastic book ruined Any traveller will tell you that India LP is the essential book when backpacking the sub continent. Well, they would have told you that until this was released.<br />Not content on having the perfect, highly rated travel guide that was the result of 30 years research Lonely Planet took the odd decision to reformat this version.<br />Gone is the map at the front of the book, gone is the map with border crossings, gone are the logical orders of hotels by pricing (now they're mixed) gone has the quality images and itineraries. Essentially what has happened is that someone from another travel guide publisher must have got behind the scenes and managed to ruin this once amazing book. I simply cannot think of any other logical reason for the re format. You only have to search the Thorn Tree forums on Lonely Planet to see just how many people are confused and bewildered at the new format. It has left backpackers all over the world with their jaws on the floor at such a dephiling of what was an amazing book.<br /><br />This version is simply useless, I strongly suggest that you get the previous version of India, for that is truly an amazing book and essential for anyone visiting the subcontinent.",0
"Laugh-Whine-Obsess 'Eat, Pray, Love...' was a book I liked and disliked at the same time. On the one hand, it was fresh, witty and fun, on the other hand, it would devolve into obsessive ruminations about Liz Gilbert's failed marriage, her attempt to find God and her sadness and perceived \\""""misery\\"""". It was at once clever and boring, hot and cold, cathartic and self-indulgent.     The book begins with Liz Gilbert questioning her marriage. She ultimately leaves her husband, finds a boyfriend, gets rid of him too and thus starts the quest for God and the meaning of \\""""her\\"""" life. She does this by eating her way through Italy, praying and meditating in India and hanging out and making whoopee in Bali. Initially I loved her insight and wit. I found myself actually laughing out loud at her intuitive commentary, but then I found myself getting bored (and frankly irritated) at her droning on and on about being so sad and devastated, and the pain she was in, and the heartache, and sorrow and misery, ad nauseam. I was waiting for her to describe something truly miserable, heart-breaking or tragic that had happened in her life, but all I found was a woman who went through a couple of failed relationships and acts like she's the only one in the world who's been through it. I kept thinking, good grief, get over yourself girl! I mean, really, the majority of women who go through divorces (or worse) pick themselves up and move on without self-indulgent self-reflection for a week, nonetheless a whole year! Most of the women I know have no time for self-pity, and Liz Gilbert was \\""""The Queen\\"""" of self-pity (at least in this book). It started out funny, witty and insightful in Italy, crescendoing to a full-bore whine in India, and ending back to her whiny and self-absorbed persona in Bali. She goes through life as a Drama Queen, and she seems to see every misstep or unpleasant experience as so devastating. I think a person who grew up in an intact, two-parent home, married once to a husband who loved and provided for her (and who has been able to promptly find replacements for him), in addition to always seeming to be able to get what she needs when she needs it, whether it's food, travel, love, or money, is not someone who needs to be writing a book about her perceived sorrow and misery. She needs to give many, many thanks, stop obsessing, and MOVE ON!",0

"Better than Livin Things After the insipid release of Livin Things, I swore off LP. I loved the first three albums, and whilst Thousand suns was not my thing, I appreciated the bold new direction.<br /><br />However, having read various interviews in the media, I thought I would give LP another chance.<br /><br />First off, this is a much better album than Livin Things.<br /><br />That said, it is still not up to the standard of LP at their height.<br /><br />There are three problems with this album. First off is the texture; this doesn't feel like an LP album - it feels much more like Fort Minor with all the various &#34;featurings&#34; and political content. Now there is nothing wrong with that - I didn't mind The Rising Tide - but I bought an LP album, and that was what I was expecting.<br /><br />Secondly, the standard of composition and songwriting... look, we've come to expect so much from LP, but there are no gospel-esque harmonies over a metal riff. It's just straight rap metal in a Rage Against The Machine/ System of A Down kinda way... and it's certainly not as good as either of those two bands.<br /><br />Now that said, there are some good songs on here; &#34;Guilty All The Same&#34; is a cracking track, as is &#34;Final Masquerade&#34;.<br /><br />Which brings us on to the third problem of this album; the bonus DVD.<br />It's great. I mean really, it's brilliant. LP in a full live onslaught, and a crowd in fine voice.<br /><br />Why is this a problem? Because it provides a stark comparison to the studio album... and the older material wipes the floor with the newer.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you are are a hardcore LP fan, then the bonus DVD is worth the price of the package alone, and you'll love it.<br />However, if you a more reserved then you will find the studio album to be a tired, by-the-numbers average affair which never recaptures the early intensity or genius of Linkin Park.<br /><br />Think carefully before buying.",0

"Disappointment \\""""Where to begin?\\""""<br /><br />The question must have been asked a hundred times by the creators of this film, trying to create a successful re-make of the Alec Guiness classic.<br /><br />They did not come up with the right answers, at least for this viewer.<br /><br />The DVD starts out with more of the idiotic trailers for films inserted by the sadistic people who inhabit the marketing departments of the film studios. Five of them, if memory serves. Does anyone think I am going to give a thought to any of these other offerings ten years from now when I replay the DVD? I buy the DVD for the movie, not for the £$%^&* trailers.<br /><br />Finally the Main Menu - and after \\""""Play!\\"""" is clicked, the obligatory five or so movie companies strut their logos (as if the audience gives a tinker's damn or a tailor's stitch), and you are at last allowed to start watching the movie - squinting. The movie was for the most part shot with inadequate lighting, perhaps to increase the obscurity of the plot, nearly impossible to follow as the film jumps back and forth from an office Christmas party to parts foreign, from well-lit home to dark and nasty safe houses and offices, subterranean holes and dim cafes.<br /><br />The story is unclear, the plot as well, the writing may be brilliant for crossword fanatics, but not for real people. The direction is ham-handed the editing terrible. Can't they afford decent lighting?<br /><br />Frankly, I would recommend you buy a good copy of the Alec Guinness version and leave this DVD for someone else to buy.",0

"Blair Witch Version 2.0 The reason I have titled this review \\""""Blair Witch Version 2.0\\"""" is because this is actually a very similar film. Just change the setting from the woods to a seemingly ordinary house, switch the three college kids making a video project to a young couple who are trying to capture strange goings-on in their home with a video camera. Move the time setting from the mid 90's to the mid-2000's, with the same idea that the footage was recovered sometime after the event, then subsequently compiled into a film for our pleasure. And there you have it.<br /><br />The shaky, hand-held camera style of filming from [[ASIN:B0037Z969Q The Blair Witch Project [DVD] [1999]]] (and also [[ASIN:B0014E9174 Cloverfield [DVD] [2007]]]) is present here, as is the eventually constant bickering between the main characters. They are trying to capture the strange phenomena occurring in the house while they sleep, and for much of the film, the eeriness only happens at night, with the daylight spent analysing and arguing over what happened, and what they should do next.<br /><br />Even before you watch the film, the DVD increases expectations of fear by supplying a kind of post-viewing recovery guide within the case (containing helpful suggestions for how to cope after seeing this supposedly bed-wettingly scary film, such as \\""""Open a window\\"""" and \\""""Breath in and out slowly\\"""", etc.). The film itself is pretty successful at building up an atmosphere of fear and dread through the use of it's hand-held camera style and through the way that the night time bedroom scenes are filmed.  The camera is positioned so that you not only get a clear view of the sleeping victims but also of the darkened, open doorway. The bumps, crashes, moving objects and occasional inhuman voices that perpetuate the couple's nights seem to be preparing you for the real terror. This raises the expectation that something truly terrifying is about to happen... eventually.<br /><br />But, I cannot give this film more than 3 out of 5 here. For me it just didn't ever pack the punch that it promised to deliver with all of it's creepy, lo-fi build up. Only one part of the film made me jump, which came very late on and didn't really disturb me at all after it had happened. Once you are over the strange noises and movements, and expecting something more frightening, very little materialises. I was watching on a large TV screen in my living room the dark from 10.30 pm onwards, just to ramp up the fear factor, and still I slept very well afterwards. The fact that I slept like a baby straight after watching means it can't have been a particularly successful horror in my opinion, but that's just how I judge it.<br /><br />On the positive side, unlike quite a lot of reviewers I found the acting of the two leads very believable and quite realistic. I also found them a lot more likeable than the Blair Witch characters. The way that the visuals were carried off on such a low budget was also commendable. But it seems like the Hollywood hype-machine has done the job again, just like it did about 10 years ago on the last generation of teenagers who got hooked on 'Blair'. A missed opportunity, but as missed opportunities go it's not the worst thing you'll ever see. Just don't expect to be traumatised.<br /><br />If you like horror films which feature similar themes to this one why not try the classic [[ASIN:B00004CZQS The Exorcist [DVD] [1974]]] (if you haven't already seen it) or Sam Raimi's brilliant, darkly comic demon-possession film [[ASIN:B002EEODBC Drag Me to Hell [DVD] [2009]]].n't ever pack the punch that it promised to deliver with all of it's creepy, lo-fi build up.

"What a load of tosh. I cannot believe I wasted a whole day of my life reading this drivel (the only reason I did because I'd run out of books on holiday and borrowed this one). I should have known better than to read on when I realised in the the first few pages that the idea had been lifted from the 1990's film Sneakers, even quoting a line from the film ('no more secrets'), without even so much as a nod to it! Then when the perfect woman meets the perfect man, I was torn between putting it down or throwing up in the nearest bin! Perfect woman (who every man is in love with of course) has an IQ of 170, is the worlds leading genius in the code-breaking field, yet somehow manages to do absolutely nothing at all (apart from get in the way)& is the most gullible, naive & useless article I've ever read about.  She 'teaches' her perfect boyfriend basic code-breaking & he turns out to be better at it than she is! Perfect boyfriend, who is a mere language genius, then turns out to be stupid enough to accept an undercover mission without so much as a slight raised eyebrow & turns into James Bond, engaging in every chase/pursuit cliche in history! Added to which, the 'twists' in the tail were more like 'written in letters six feet high obvious' and the 'cliff-hanger' ending was as long as a bank holiday weekend and just as predictable.  People say his later books get better - well, here's another thing that's predictable - they sure as hell can't get any worse!",0
Four Stars Simular to &#34;Gone Girl&#34;,1
"Hit-Girl, the movie, starring Kick-Ass Over the past decade Super-Hero movies have built their reputation to become a popular and well respected genre of film by geeks and casual movie-goers alike as people suspend reality for a two hour glimpse into their childhood dreams. But with great popularity, comes great potential for a spoof or a satire. And for every ‘Kick-Ass’ there’s a ‘Superhero movie’.<br /><br />Thankfully, Kick-Ass 2 kept the momentum going from the first outing. The key to the first films success was not only it’s gratuitous violence or the much disputed use of a young girl swearing, but how obvious it was that the cast and crew are blatant comic lovers. It didn’t degrade comic fans, it instead opted to wink at us with a cheeky grin whilst blazing through a plethora of unrelenting action scenes that embraced what we love about the genre, sometimes prodding fun at some of it’s weaknesses.<br /><br />Picking up a few months after the climax of the previous instalment, Chris D’Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is blinded by grief from the passing of his father, causing him to ignite a vendetta against Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), aiming to destroy him with his new team, ‘The Toxic Mega C*nts’. Meanwhile, Kick-Ass’ recent heroics motivate many more ordinary people to don mask and cape to fight crime, including Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey) who orchestrates an alliance against the new super-villians in town.<br /><br />Throughout the feature there seems to be more of a focus on Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) than before, perhaps due to her popularity in the previous film as the sword-wielding badass with a love for ultra-violence and profanity. It delves further into her normal life as Mindy as she attempts to acclimatise herself to a more standard life after the passing of her father. It hits all the conventions of a film about teenage growth whilst adding the superhero twist to proceedings as she struggles through an identity crisis. I thought some of thehumour fell flat, such as the ‘Sick Stick’ scene which felt a little forced in comparison to some of the wit of the first instalment.<br /><br />On the other hand, the almost unrecognisable Jim Carrey fits seamlessly into the boots of Colonel Stars and Stripes with his ludicrous persona which perfectly suits his humour and the style of the movie, however, he has a criminal lack of screen-time.<br /><br />Although Jeff Wadlow doesn’t always reach the heights that Matthew Vaughn set previously, he achieves a balance between the gritty nature, and its whimsy, surpassing my expectations. It stays true to what Kick-Ass is, and why it is so beloved. It isn’t just a spoof of superhero films, but a love-letter which holds all the best parts of the genre. It then proceeds to shoot it up with a shot of adrenaline whilst sending it running on its way, watching chaos ensue. A strong chunk of summer entertainment, it really doesn’t pull any punches and continues to build upon an already solid idea. My only questions are, “Where can it go from here?” and “Will it become repetitive?”. With Mark Millar already publishing the next set of comics, I guess we may find out soon enough.",0
Strange but compelling story Good read,0
"Four Stars Good book, still reading it atleast once a week!",1
"Not one of her best *SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*    I was one of the many Kinsella fans eagerly waiting out the months for this book, but sadly I now wish I had waited to buy a second-hand copy. I must have spent around £16.00 on this book that I can't really afford and I feel rather cheated of my money. Yes, it was worth reading, but not worth buying at that price.     The main disappointment was that the title rather suggested most of the plot would revolve around Becky's daughter and that Minnie was rather taking after her mother in the shopping department.  Instead we barely even get to know Minnie and she spends far too much of her time apart from her mother or is seemingly forgotten. Also, I would not say Minnie is taking after her mother in a love for shopping, mainly as she is only two and is more interested in causing the same havoc over and over again.    The plot was rather bity and the main events seemed to be Luke's surprise party, Elinor's grief over losing Luke, their latest house problems (which after much promise falls through), a cash crisis, Suze and Tarquin's problems and a couple of brief and pointless visits from nannies.  One of the most hilarious things was when Nanny Sue came along to assess Minnie and the problems they were having with her and after recording Minnie being banned from yet another shop claims that nothing is wrong with the way they are dealing with her- and after all that build up that things need to be resolved here!    I also felt that although there were many funny moments, the different aspects of the plot were not all as developed as one would have expected. For example, the issue with everyone having to cut back. The only thing becky does is to not buy clothes and there was not much humour over how tragic this is for her!    I did find the meetings between Minnie and Elinor very touching though and I really wished there had been more of this!   Overall, it is a nice read but something you should not spend much money on. I hope the next doesnot go down the same road!",0

"What happened to the rest of it? This Audio CD of the classic children's tale written by E. Nesbit is a bit of a disappointment. It's well produced, the narration by Lynda Bellingham is good but I can't help but think you'll feel a bit ripped off.<br /><br />It comes to you on a single CD with a running of around 1 hour long and just too much has been taken out. In fact, it's been butchered. I suppose an abridged version has it's place, but I think most parents and children will want to hear the full tale of the five children who stumbled across the sand fairy that grants wishes. Sadly, you won't find that here.",0
"Absolutely amazing I had watched The O.C. before and just had to get it on DVD before it disappears from the market. The series itself is just absolutely amazing. The way the characters are written gives even the supporting characters depth that is rarely seen even in the main cast. In my opinion it is one of the best television series' ever made!<br /><br />The box in which the products are delivered looks good and suits the series' scenery quite nicely. The DVD's have all those legal disclaimers that usually annoy to watch at the start of every disc, have been placed at the end of every disc. This means you'll save yourself those precious five minutes of quality time with Summer, Marissa, Ryan and Seth!<br /><br />Definitely a product well worth it's price.",1

"Brilliant One of my new favourite films! White House Down is amazing, exhilarating and one of those films that has you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Brilliant film!",1
bargain of the year Tim's first five albums for under a tenner? Bargain of the year. If they had squeezed Starsailor into the box then it would be bargain of the century. Starsailor is hard to find on cd though (not talking about the anthology cd). Contractual problems that go back to the Herb Cohen/Frank Zappa lawsuit. Anyway - drifting away from the point. Five sensational albums and a unique talent.,1
Five Stars i love it,1

"Absolutely amazing This app is absolutely brilliant. There are hundreds of dragons you can breed. Great graphics and good gameplay too.<br /><br />The only downside is the fact you have to buy certain types of dragon with gold e.g. magic... therefore you would have to BUY it with REAL money. If you could just breed all dragons normally, this app would be a five star.<br /><br />Still, I do recommend the app.<br /><br />Good luck dragon breeding!  :-)",1
"Quite a good story - the word &#34;knickers&#34; gets my children giggling! Anything with the word &#34;knickers&#34; in, gets my kids vote!  They like it guessing by the giggles and the pointing to the different pairs of knickers the queen has.  I have to say I personally found it a bit short and would have liked a bit more to the story - only a few words on each page - so for me it falls a bit flat.  But my children like it and they are the market after all.",0

"It's not what I expected. I was really looking forward to recieving this product, but when it I arrived I was a little disappointed.

"Rip off time again from the remaining Queen members Firstly there is nothing wrong with the quality of the music on this album, Queen were one of the greatest rock bands to walk this world.<br />But it seems to me now that the remaining members are just after cashing in on former glories and this CD just further reinforces my opinion that they have nothing creative to bring to the table now so just rehash old hits.<br /><br />I would recommend for anybody wanting to have some of their music to go for the Platinum collection which comprises of greatest hits 1,2, and 3 alternatively buy greatest hits 1 and 2 separately as 3 in itself does not hold much for a casual listener.",0
"Revisionist cr*p!!!! This is possibly one of the worst films ever made about WW2. Besides being mediocre cinema, my gripe is that this is a blatant distortion of history. It trivialises the brave efforts of the Royal Navy in capturing the first naval Enigma machine from U110 and the dedicated work of chiefly Polish mathematicians in breaking the codes. When will Hollywod stop rewriting history? Probably never!   Films like this should be piled up and set on fire in case our children ever see them and think they are historical truth!",0

"A Bit Disappointing... I bought this book thinking it would be the missing piece to explain why I am the way I am, however the more I read into it, the more I realised that it was just a compilation of traits, that everyone exhibits to some extent. However the only difference I'd say between a HSP and a \\""""normal\\"""" person, would be that a HSP is more introverted, due to environmental reasons, technically making them an introvert, and the whole HSP thing just one big marketing gimmick, directed towards people who feel \\""""different\\"""" to the rest of society. Basically selling them a sense of belonging and superiority, in the form of paperback books.",0
"MASTERPIECE. A Masterpiece by the Brilliant Scorpions. Every track is great but my personal favourite's are Make it Real, Lady Starlight, Only a Man, and The Zoo. And the title track is the best track on the album, so to sum all the album up in one word, BRILLIANT !.",1

"Not the best I've read, but will finish this trilogy nonetheless I'm of a two minds with Wool. While I burned through this first part of the trilogy, I did so at times slightly cringing.<br /><br />First to the good: I am genuinely engrossed by this story and can't wait to find out more in Shift and Dust. The story is entirely original, with well-thought out structure and geography - both in terms of the story itself as well as the world of the Silo and the world of the outside.<br /><br />Then the slightly cringeworthy part: the writing is not fantastic. The book pushes on off the strength of the plot, of the story itself, but the writing itself is unpolished, unconvincing, pedestrian, even, at times. At times it felt like the author should have written one last edit to iron out those kinks that, at least to me, disrupted the flow of language and storyline, and disturbed the engagement that I had with the story.<br /><br />That having been said, this trilogy will never be a favourite of mine, and rather than buying the next two instalments I'll be happy to wait until I can check them out of the library.",0
Brilliant book I love this book. It is a real eye opener for me and is helping me in changing the way in which i think and act. Would definately recomend this book to anyone.,1

"Copy of 50 shades of grey..... I'm only a few pages into this book, but already it's obvious it's a blatant copy of 50 shades. It starts off with Eva (similar to Ana) falling over in front of the sexy, rich, slightly dangerous seeming handsome god-like man...now where does that seem familiar from?<br /><br />There's no subtly, as soon as she falls over and looks at him, she feels instantly that she wants to have red hot sex with him. This just doesn't do it for me.",0

"Disturbing It's not easy being a Trivium fan; it's been one big roller-coaster ride right from the start. Ember to Inferno got things moving nicely, only for Ascendancy to take us to the very top with one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Then Crusade - a sad attempt to emulate Metallica's (at the time) success with the mainstream music channels. Shogun was a so much better and for me (again at the time) a return to form. But on reflection it was a knee-jerk reaction to its lackluster predecessor. Thank god for the crushing In Waves, back almost to the dizzy heights of Ascendency ... then this. Back down we go again!<br /><br />I can't fault the musicianship, perhaps on that score it's their best yet, but Draiman ... what have you done? Trivium are not an extension of your own musical aspirations! But I can't blame him if he's been left to produce it his way. However I find that sentence hard to accept as I can't imagine Matt allowing him to literally take over. `To Believe' is 100% pure Disturbed! I just don't get it.<br /><br />Ironically it's not until the last three tracks that the real Trivium emerge, as if Draiman had gone home having thought the album was finished and then Matt said, \\""""Quick lads he's gone. Now it's OUR turn!\\"""" Sadly too little, too late.<br /><br />So for now I will sit back and relax until the next (hopefully Draiman-Free) release sees me back on the Trivium roller-coaster for perhaps their ultimate thrill ride. It cant go any lower.",0

"unusual story Very good read if rather sad, although a happy ending.  Interesting insight into how people react after great grief.  I read it all in just over a day!",1
"Premise good, not worth the paper. Even in spite of its tiny size this book is mostly fluff. The basic premise is fine, but if you´ve read the store page description you´ve read everything in the book. I bought the book under the assumption that concrete ways of distinquishing dips from cul-de-sacs would be provided, but none were.<br />The author also makes numerous assertions about how aspects of life and business works, without citing a single source. I understand that self-help litterature is supposed to be largely oppinion based, but many asertions made are factual. At one point a graph is presented of when during a marathon most people quit, which is certainly a statistic that should have come from a verifiable source. The lack of one makes me suspect that the author drew the graph free-hand to underline a point, without checking if the data was legitimate.<br />I also greatly dislikes the way the author strokes the readers ego as being a potentially extraordinary person at the expense of repeatedly insulting ordinary (or I believe the term used is simply &#34;most&#34;) people and describing them as dumb and useless, but that´s just politics.",0

"Still Mystified..?! I bought this as it has such a killer reputation, the king of the anime movies.

A biker club of supposed 'friends' that are actually a gang of murderous thugs that don't even seem to get on with each other at the best of times, who go off on gang fights with other bike gangs and cause havoc and destruction in New Tokyo City...after some kind of cataclysm.<br /><br />It would not be so bad if the characters within the gang that we are introduced to actually acted liked they even liked each other, but they don't really.  In fact no one except Tetsuo, who is the one that is most badly affected by the weird goings-on, seems to care about much of anything.  In his case, a girl they 'rescued' from rival gang, just as she was being badly beaten and abused.<br /><br />Still does not make much sense, but looks and sounds the business!",0

"Nothing like the original I saw this film at the cinema. being a fan of the classic robocop movies I was hoping to be in for something good. Well I was wrong. This remake is cheese for the fans of the original movie! It has none of the traditions of what made the original robocop movies so famous. The story is not even the same as the original, this remake has a really dull storyline that feels more like a marvel superhero movie rather than a non child friendly tale of corruption and stereotype of the original robocop. Making a child friendly reboot of an 80's classic film that offered so much horror and gore with an extreme taste of crime at its most disturbing is like making a reboot of saw for a teen audience! all the nasties and gore/horror/depravity.sexual and evil content/ brutality and discrimination have been taken away from the idea of this reboot, instead they have thrown in moderated violence you would expect from power rangers, totally dull scenes with very little to keep you interested. There is no gore. No prostitutes. no drug use. no bad ass criminals. no classic and important remade scenes from the original. no swearing. The one good thing is the sadness it has to offer. Some scenes are way to draggy and boring and most of those scenes are the parts that are meaningless to the films storyline. Alex does not die the same way the classic film shows. he dies during a planted bomb on his car which is something used in soaps like emmerdale and eastenders and the bill rather than a modern day action movie. even the reboot of dread felt more like a reboot of robocop than this dull childrens film.<br /><br />isnt the point of a modern remake to make the reboot more gory and disturbing than its original ?<br /><br />even worse is the black robocop amer, the classic robocop armer looked more realistic and more modern, even better made than the reboot amer.<br />it even lacks action scenes theres hardly anything action wise going on in this film.<br />for all fans of robocop do not watch this cheesey reboot.",0
"All HP fans will read this final part but do not expect too much As a HP fan like many others I was looking forward to this final book. Of course I had to buy and read it, but as a whole it was not true to my expectancy. The first half of the book is rather slowly paced with few interesting events, it is starting the second half of the book that it is JK Rowling as usual with exciting chapters. The very last chapter does make space for another book to be written (if ever?) of our hero. Unfortunately while it does give some clues how it ends with the main characters, we do not learn what happens with a lot of other people of the books, which considering the length of the series (7 books) should have been mentioned at least and is a weakness of the story.<br />Without revealing the story for example one wonder what at the end happens with Loona Lovegood, The Dursleys or Dean Thomas to name just a few.<br />It feels that the author has just tried to cover the final book trying not to reveal everything so she could write again more if she wishes to.",0
I dont really get how to do it but I love it It's quite confusing and it isn't the best game but I love having a sort of responsibility and I just love,1
"A rocky start to this series I have to say, coming off the high of The Last Olympian, this book is plain and simple: a letdown.<br /><br />Let's start, however, with the positives. I was immediately ecstatic when I started reading because Riordan had decided to switch to third person narrative. I've always been a bigger fan of this style of writing, and here it did the story justice as well. The immediate result is a tone that just seems a lot more mature, and that suits the story because the characters are now in the later teen years.<br /><br />Riordan stuck to his winning formula, but honestly the sixth time... He's walking a thin line - kind of getting repetitive. I'm fully aware however that my exhaustion with the formula is due to me reading all of these Riordan books in a row. However, that was never an issue with, for example, Harry Potter.<br /><br />Although the story started slow, the last quarter of it definitely picked up and made up for some of the...shortcomings.<br /><br />Now, I may have ruined this book for myself by reading at a slow pace (averaging 10% per day), but hey, exams are next week, give me a break. But whether or not that be the reason, I just could not connect to these characters. They're plucked out of nowhere, no introduction at all, and honestly during the whole book all I'm thinking is \\""""Where is Percy?\\"""" \\""""What's Annabeth doing?\\"""" \\""""Can they meet up already?\\"""" I had no patience for these new characters. I couldn't relate to them, but I can't put my finger on why. At the end, Leo is the only one of the new \\""""main\\"""" characters that I thought was sort of cool. He'd really be cool if he stopped thinking that every girl that comes along is hot. Piper annoys the HELL out of me because she's... she's like the damsel in distress, Mary Sue character, but then they try to make her better than that by giving her mindbending powers? But no actual fighting strength? And honestly, reading her POV, her convictions aren't that strong anyway. In the first half of the book I just wanted to halfway strangle her because of the teenage angst. I like my female characters to be good for something. But hey, she's Aphrodite's daughter. Surprise, surprise. And Jason. I don't want to be so hard on him because he lost his memories, but the result of that is that he became a completely stiff and static character. Even now, having finished the book, I have no idea how I would describe him or his personality, and that to me is a sign that you haven't fleshed out your characters enough.<br /><br />That all being said, I think the multiple POV style probably contributed to not being able to connect to them. Multiple POV to me is such a disjointed writing style and the result is I don't have a grasp or true liking of any of the characters. Although, since the three characters were still there, together, for all the events, Riordan did multiple POV better than some other books I've read recently. However, I do still think it was unnecessary! Honestly, if the whole book had been from Jason's POV I think it would have been much better. I'd gladly read the thoughts of someone desperately grasping for any hints of his old memories and who he truly is. That sounds way more appealing than what we ended up with here. And that may have enabled me to like a couple of the characters more. (Never not never ever need to read Piper's POV.)<br /><br />The story itself seemed a bit contrived... I can't help it. I mean, at the beginning they're given a prophecy to save Hera and then the whole journey long they just think about saving Piper's dad. I get it, that's important too, and it would be heartless not to. But you know, when the result is that at the end they were JUST A BIT too late to stop Porphyrion from rising.... it's just... Exhausting. Also, all the constant hinting, \\""""Oh, it's forbidden to speak of this, I swore on the River Styx\\"""" \\""""You must find out for yourself, or it will have no meaning\\"""" - it's a requirement for these fantasy/adventure books, I know, but after 50th time, you start wanting to bang your head against the wall.<br /><br />The ending just completely killed the book. I mean, it wasn't a surprise. Honestly, if you hadn't figured it all out yet by like halfway through the book, you weren't paying attention. But when it's just written like that: Percy's in the Roman camp. He has to prove himself to aggressive Roman demigods. And he probably has no memories whatsoever. My reaction: UMMM CAN THIS BOOK BE REDONE FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THEN? Seriously. I feel like his story would be SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING than this one.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think for one: I should have read this book more continuously to be able to enjoy it. My fault, I admit. But furthermore: it rushed into the story, introducing characters I had absolutely no idea about and just kept me from connecting. For this book I was really on the outside, looking in, and that left way too many opportunities to roll my eyes at the characters, their actions and their thoughts. That was never a problem during Percy Jackson & the Olympians. I will, however, continue with the series. I'm not giving up here. Despite the issues I had with it, it wasn't all bad, hence the 3.5 rating. I firmly believe that once Percy comes around I will truly enjoy it again. And the prophecy sounds interesting enough.<br /><br />Recommended for: fans of Percy Jackson.th time, you start wanting to bang your head against the wall.<br /><br />The ending just completely killed the book.

The sex scene is short but damn hot :P The great thing about it is the (short-lived) tension between the two women especially as one is dating a dangerous (for lack of better word) gangster and finds 'true love' and happiness with this new (very hot) woman, Corky. Also, the fact that at the end, they're still together, that made me smile :) The sexual tension thing, as I mentioned, was pretty short-lived as they sorta get together etc quite quick.. but aye it was a decent watch, little boring though.",0

"Disturbing in parts but an average film.... I've been aching to watch Salo for quite some time now, and was constantly finding it on the internet labelled as one of the most disturbing films of all time.<br /><br />I have to say I was just a little dissapointed with it - yes it was disturbing in some parts, and it was darkly funny too - but the film itself was just a 2 hour excursion into sexual depravity, and the film itself doesn't really deserve the acclaim that it recieves in my opinion.<br /><br />The script and cinematography are distinctly average, and yes, it is sometimes funny - but after the first half an hour is up, you begin to become immune to anything happening on screen. From then on it's just a case of sitting through some poo eating and some more anal sex.<br /><br />This is worth taking the time to watch, and I think the inital premise of Salo is disturbing. However, I can't help but think that an alternative director with a darker vision, would have made all the difference, because as it stands I just don't think that it deserves all the praise it's given.",0
"And the visuals??? In view of the fact the boxset release of the studio albums had reasonable amounts of bonus visuals on dvd, you would have thought that  someone at Genesis management would have had the foresight to include some previously unreleased video gems like Live @ the lyceum 1980 and   film of the 76/77 tour that would become Seconds Out to name but two.  Also considering this is a live compilation spanning 34 years, why is there barely anything from the hugely successful 1986/1987 Invisible Touch tour namely In too deep, Mama,& Thats All added to the end of the 1992 TWWW remix. Why not include an audio mix of the whole concert to include the In The Cage medley that was never included in the original VHS / DVD release. This would surely appeal to the fans and I would not hesitate to invest. As it is and for the reasons mentioned   above,I'm out.",0
"Clever and arid All very impressive - different strands, literary allusions and all the other paraphernalia of a modern literary novel - but it reads as though more designed to be admired and studied than to be read and enjoyed. One of many books that seems written by someone who has spent too long in academic departments of English literature, and written chiefly to be read by others within academic departments of English literature. All body and no soul. A reminder of how much more technically proficient so many modern writers are than those who went before them, and yet how little pleasure is usually to be had from reading a contemporary novel in place of a classic.",0

"A bit of a rip off! First of all, I loved the presentation - both in the book and in the TV follow up. BUT - you have to have 1) a real working kitchen(i.e. a kitchen you can really work in NOT the usual family kitchen)  and 2) many more utensils than you really need.    Then you may encounter the problem that many ingredients won't be found in the same place - you will have to visit two or three groceries/supermarkets in order to find the ingredients for one dish! So, the time encountered in finding the ingredients can be onerous.    I have been cooking for many years but after trying just one of the recipes in this book - Cypriot Chicken - I will not try anymore. For example, in this recipe one needs to have three LARGE frying pans - how many homes keep these as a regular requirement? This recipe calls pitta bread flat bread - why not just call it pitta bread?    One advantage is that we bought the book in Sainsbury's at the reduced price of £[..] - which is just about what this volume is worth. The illustrations are very good.    Practicality nil!",0

The Legend of 1900 is an amazing very underrated movie Watched The Legend of 1900 a couple of years ago and I loved it. I was very surprised by the great story and the music playing in the movie. This movie is rarely shown on tv and many people never heard of it. It is one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen. The blu ray quality is really good. The detail is very good. The blu ray is in Italian and English language which is great. The main menus are in English and its easy to select. Some may think because its an Italian blu ray you may have difficulties but you will not. The movie is just amazing and on blu ray is even better. You wont be disapointed. Just get it. Great seller and fast delivery. Really happy with service.,1

"Not a lot to smile about OK, bring on the hate mail. I just don't get this. What a mess. No doubt IT CONTAINS SOME BRILLIANT MOMENTS but that's all they are, brilliant moments, smothered amongst 5 CD's of noodling.  I'm not a Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fanatic so perhaps it's all just lost on me but I really don't see how anyone can appreciate a CD full of bits and pieces of Heroes & Villains and lots of studio chatter. The hours of tinkling away on a piano just seem pointless. Some great music came out of these sessions but, for me, hearing bits and pieces played over and over again just detracts from the achievements of the few finished songs that are actually on these discs. Even 'The finished article' is a handful of songs interspersed with odds and ends.  Expected to like this one but found it a HUGE disappointment.",0
don't waste your time I bought this because of the star-studded cast and because I had just enjoyed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (which was excellent).  But what a plodding. directionless bore Quartet is.<br /><br />We kept waiting for the film to get going but it never did.  Don't waste your time or money on this.  Astonishingly poor considering the names in the cast.,0

"Disappointing Audio Description Now I'm not a petty man but this title is X-Men Days of Future Past: RogueCut, now seeing what this title is called you would think that the extended cut would be the main and only feature on this  BluRay apart from the usual extras. Well I'm visually impaired and I need a feature called Audio Description to tell me what actions and general environment are happening on screen while nobody is speaking in the film. Now this title says it has Audio Description and seeing as it has a logo and it says in words that English audio description is in the list of languages on the back cover, you would think that the audio description would be on the extended rogue cut, but no they have also put the standard film on the disc and put the AD on that. I already own the standard film I got it on the day of release, I feel totally let down by Fox Entertsinment. What is the point of putting the standard film on there as well when they know full well that the only reason anybody is buying this is for the extended cut only. I think they put the standard film on there to say that it has Audio Description on the disc &#34;so they are doing their part for the blind&#34; when they are NOT because for the blind it is just a repackaged rerelease of the same film a few months later.<br /><br />And do FOX care?! NO<br />Sorry about that, had to get that off my chest.",0

"Yawn Over-rated rubbish. As a collection of songs it isn't a patch on other Beatles albums. Twee and typical of 1967. Lovely Rita Meter Maid, When I'm 64, With a Little Help From My Friends, Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds: - none have aged well.     They are lucky to have survived this album. Most other 60's groups that made a psychedelic album disappeared into obscurity soon after.  I would have to agree that the production was years ahead of most other British albums of it's day but that is mainly down to George Martin and it's a shame that he didn't have better songs to work with. The Beatles popularity was in question at the time(the 'bigger than Jesus' comment, lack of touring etc)subsequently their record label wanted a classic single to repair the damage with the result that Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane were sacrificed. If those songs had remained a part of Sgt.Pepper; replacing weaker songs such as Lovely Rita, When I'm 64 or Benefit of Mr.Kite I think it would have been a far stronger record and would also have allowed Lucy In the Sky to fit more comfortably in the running order.  There probably won't be many Beatles fans that will agree with this review but I would ask just two questions: - 'When was the last time you actually played it?' and 'When was the time before that?'.  If you are looking for a starting place to 'get into' The Beatles try Rubber Soul, Revolver or Hard Days Night. All 3 are stronger albums than this one.    The following note was added a couple of years after the above review:     I recently read an article in 'Flashback' magazine that recommended listening to the mono version of Sgt.Pepper rather than the stereo version as it sounds far more like a Beatles record: I didn't really understand that comment until I took the plunge and got hold of a mono version.    To be honest I didn't expect any real difference but have to report that it actually sounds like a totally different record. If you want to make a quick comparison play the first few seconds of 'Fixing a Hole' in stereo and then play the mono version; the difference is unbelievable. I expected the music to sound cluttered behind the vocals but the reverse is true. The music is far higher in the mix and the record sounds so much better for it. I can actually listen to the album and get some enjoyment from it which is something that I never thought I'd be able to say about this album.    Apparently George Harrison said that you have to hear the mono version to appreciate the record and I whole heartedly agree. I'm not some vinyl junkie who thinks that mono is better than stereo but in this case there really isn't any comparison between the two versions; the mono mix is superior in every way.    Even if you have a stereo copy and love it, do yourself a favour and get hold of a mono copy; I'm pretty certain that you won't regret it.",0

"Interesting Not a book I would usually gravitate towards myself, but after a recommendation my interest was piqued. I did like it, and it was completely different to what I normally read so that made a refreshing change.<br /><br />I found the style of writing very engaging, and easily found myself reading one more page, then another and another.... It was great to get so far in a characters mind, and I really felt for Charlie and how he was trying to understand the trials of being a teen. It had a really unique people watching feel to it, that I haven't come across before in a book.<br /><br />I don't think I would read it again but I did enjoy it as a one off read. It really feels like one of those &#34;bucket list books&#34;, that everyone should read at least once in their lives because there are some really powerful messages in there.",0

"Thoughful Vampire film from 'Interview...' director... From the director of Interview with the Vampire, this is his first horror film for many, many years but it is well made like all of his various films.<br />It does feel quite similar to Interview.. in some ways obviously, except here we have two female vampires, moving from town to town around the quite sea-side part of England. It has a good thoughful script, very well acted by some, but does get a little slow and confused. ultimately this is a very good, different and original vampire film very worth seeing.",1
"Not as angry....not as good! A very disappointing follow-up to Jagged Little Pill, this album is still clever - good lyrics, her brilliant voice, but it just doesn&#x27;t come up to the standard of her first album. Where is the passion? Maybe satisfying for true Morissette fans, but not for me. In fact, I am a true Morissette fan - I think she&#x27;s brilliant, but this album was simply not as good as the first and that&#x27;s all there is to it.",0
"Need to watch the first to understand the second I loved the first one, so had high expectations for the sequel, and I wasn't disappointed. Without giving anything away, a lot of twists in the first are answered in the second. Would recommend to movie buffs who like a clever scare, rather than ghost jumps out the closet type.",1

"Enjoyable but far-fetched and poor ending CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />It was quite a good read but I can't help thinking it purports to be a serious novel when really it has as many plot holes as a James Bond film.<br /><br />Adam Kindred's first decision (running away when he had the real killer unconscious with the police round the corner.  A cursory search of the real killer's house and background would have exposed him...) was especially stupid, as was not realising the real killer would track him down through the church and kill the prostitute he had been living with.<br /><br />He managed to get a new identity easily: According to William Boyd, all men seem to look the same with a shaved head and a goatee so you can just use anyone's passport if they share that look.  Also, no questions from the hospital about why he was clearly English with an Italian ID...<br /><br />The co-incidence of meeting and ending up with the same policewoman who had found the body of Philip Wang was simply ridiculous.  Likewise, she isn't a great representative of the police force given that she is far too trusting if him when she could easily find out that he was using a fake passport.<br /><br />The ending was also unsatifactory:  why not try to get his real identity back?  He didn't believe the real killer was still after him but he knew he was no longer suspected of the death of Philip Wang.  Fair enough he would have been in a bit of bother with the authorities but would he prefer to stay as  hospital porter?",0
Utterly DREDDful! This is one of the most appalling films ever made. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. It would appear that it was made for a very specific market audience and is completely inappropriate for anyone that isn't a 12 year-old boy with a bloodlust and irresponsible parents.<br /><br />Avoid this like you'd avoid french-kissing a Leper!,0

"DISAPPOINTING I'm a huge fan of Paul McCartney and have bought most of his solo albums. He's released some terrific albums and also some pretty dreadful ones like &#34;Back to the Egg&#34;. This is rather disappointing: there are three tracks I really like (On My Way To Work, Early Days and Hosannah) but most I would file under &#34;Instantly forgettable&#34;. Just glancing through the fifteen titles as I read this, there are seven I can't even remember.<br /><br />It would be nice if &#34;My Soul&#34; (with Nitin Sawhney) had been included.",0
"don't waste your money This item was made for the Korean market. It is of extremely poor quality, l have seen better quality pirate films. The screen format is weird and unless you have a tv. that can change it it is like looking through a letterbox.focus is bad and so is the lighting(dark)",0
pretty good Trash metal This is one of the other big but not so big thrash metal bands that was dwarfed out by the likes of slayer and megadeth.<br />and despite it being pretty good I can see why it wasn't ever going to be as popular. it is more steady paced and slower and less energetic and raw I feel. Although the band themselves are just as talented and I enjoy it as piece all on its own. it is a little bit hard to enjoy completely when I have heard Slayer and the like. still worth owning in any thrash metal collection<br />but I wouldn't say they were one to start with. I will be completing my collection of them though,0

"Reqiuem It's over. Finito. And although I was never madly in love with the Delirium series, I was entertained by both the first and second books (apart from the EVIL cliffhangers) so I was looking forward to seeing how Oliver wrapped it all up.<br /><br />I wasn't sure at first that the alternating POVs of Lena and Hana would work for me. I didn't particularly like Hana in either of the first books, so I wasn't particularly interested in her perspective, but in the end I appreciated how it gave a different dimension to the plot rather than just Lena survives in forest, Lena does resistancy-type things, Lena spends nearly 400 pages trying to decide who she loves.<br /><br />Right from the beginning , I've liked the idea behind the series - that love is outlawed, that it's 'curable' and for people that truly believe in the cure, it's the reason behind a lot of the misery in the world. And in Reqiuem, Oliver continues to build on that idea, and it has a lot of creative merit.<br /><br />Lena developed a lot in Pandemonium, but to be honest I found she had slipped back a little into her Delirium-blah personality in Requiem, which is possibly in part due to the alternating POVs, but I honestly think there is just something that never fundamentally clicked about her for me. And the love-triangle thing just, ugh. I'm sure Julian is a perfectly nice boy, but he's so...unmanly. I envision him as a weedy little boy, all pale skin and mousy voice.<br /><br />Strangely, I enjoyed Hana's perspective perhaps far more than any other part of this series, when it comes to characters. I liked seeing her inner conflict and turmoil, and the way she handled it and tried to convince herself that she was feeling something else than she actually was. It sounds so strange when I say it, but I really liked that feeling of disconnect and insecurity.<br /><br />I've found this whole series pretty readable and both Pandemonium and Requiem were read-in-a-day type books for me, and that actually says a lot about how engaging I found them to be, considering neither are slim volumes.<br /><br />As a series ender, there was never going to be the possibility to please every reader - and honestly, I didn't hate it. In fact, I kinda liked it, but I have strange tastes in endings, so I'm probably just a black sheep here. And I can see how it could be disappointing for some readers - but it worked for me. Goodbye Delirum, we had some good times and bad, but overall, it was fun knowing you.ot about how engaging I found them to be, considering neither are slim volumes.<br /><br />As a series ender, there was never going to be the possibility to please every reader - and honestly, I didn't hate it.

Five Stars Absolutely awesome,1
"Gave up quickly as it was feeble I read a film review of [[ASIN:0552164135 Before I Go To Sleep]].  It trashed the movie but the story sounded good.  The review suggested the novel by SJ Watson was indeed good, and that it was just a really bad film adaptation.  So I looked up the book.  To my surprise it was very cheap so I bought it and downloaded it to the Kindle.  It has now sat unread for about a week as a low priority.    In comes this book.  It's not in a genre I'm keen on.  I just don't read these sort of airport fiction trash crime thrillers.  It's not a highbrow versus lowbrow thing - no one has ever mistaken me for an intellectual.  They just don't engage me or do anything for me.  So why did I pick up this one?  The story sounded a bit more promising than usual, but more importantly my newly discovered author was prominently quoted on the cover.  The publicity is making a big thing out this particular endorsement.  I thought I'd take a chance on it.  Something about the train setting interested me (it might be because I have very slight echoes of the film [[ASIN:B005IVLVAO Source Code]] playing in my head).  Also it seems to have been predetermined to be a bestseller in advance - so I thought surely they would back a better than average example of its genre to benefit from the marketing.    As almost always I shouldn't have bothered.  This is some thin gruel and not even remotely entertaining.  I thought trash was supposed to at least be lurid and colourful and dumbly enjoyable.  This is grey and flat.  The urge to skip pages was very, very strong.  That is not a good sign.  There just wasn't any weight to it.  I don't think the author believed in much of what she was writing.  It had thinly realised characters going through a deeply uninvolving story.  This was no fun at all.    I skipped a lot and couldn't force myself to keep going.  I closed it with pleasure after only about forty or so minutes.  I couldn't read it.  In my opinion it didn't work.    NOTE 24/9/14: I tried to read Before I Go To Sleep.  I gave up after an hour due to incredibly stupid character behaviour.  Why didn't she cover her house and possessions with useful written notes?  Not exactly rocket science.  Her failure to do so means the character is an idiot, and the writer has contempt for the intelligence of the reader.  Hitchcock got away with the suspected killer in Rear Window rarely closing his blinds, but this was too much.  Very, very bad writing.",0

"Stevie Wonder at the O2 I have been a fan of the wonderful Wonder for over 35 years and seeing him live at the O2 will live in the memory forever. When Stevie sang his hits he was truly amazing. There will be bits of the concert which I will skip past such as his 20 minute self indulgent \\""""musical interlude\\"""" where he used some weird instrument to make some very annoying sounds which caused many to leave for the bar. His political statements were also unnecessary. Overall however it was an excellent concert by a great man.",0

I had no time to return or make a complaint as I was preparing to go visit my daughter in Australia for the holidays, so I had to purchase another at a music store!

"A lot of uninspired subpar material on this 46 minute album It's Alanis Morissette by numbers.  Only two tracks (\\""""Citizen of the Planet\\"""" and \\""""Tapes\\"""") are anything that wouldn't wither and die of embarrassment in front of her Jagged Little Pill album.  There are no instrumental sections as she sings nonstop over every moment.      1. \\""""Citizen of the Planet\\""""   4:22 (7 out of 10/4 out of 5 stars)   Seems to be about coffee?  Odd lyrical perspective as she seems to sing it as the coffee?  Has an Eastern sound to it.    2. \\""""Underneath\\""""   4:07 (5/2 stars)  Fails to take flight.  As unsubtle and on the nose a writer as she is, I can't say I have any idea what this song is about - so I think it might be meaningless and just a bunch of words crowbarred in together.    3. \\""""Straitjacket\\""""   3:08 (7/3 stars)  I like it although I feel it's a bit straightforward, as though the keyboards are being played on factory presets.    4. \\""""Versions of Violence\\""""   3:36 (5/2 stars)  Seems okay but has no ending, and therefore no point.    5. \\""""Not as We\\""""   4:45 (2/1 stars)  Slow voice and piano track.  Boring music and uninteresting lyrics.  Filler masquerading as a mature introspective moment.    6. \\""""In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\""""   4:07 (5/2 stars)  It's a decent song but too twee and sickly sweet to digest without gagging.    7. \\""""Moratorium\\""""   5:35 (6/3 stars)  Indifferent song of no distinction.  Odd to sequence it after the love fest of the previous track as it's about wanting time apart.    8. \\""""Torch\\""""   4:50 (4/2 stars)  Perfectly competent and perfectly uninspired.  By numbers mid-tempo track.    9. \\""""Giggling Again for No Reason\\""""   3:48 (7/3 stars)  Starts promisingly but the borderline twee lyrics are disappointing.    10. \\""""Tapes\\""""   4:26 (8/4 stars)  Has a larger, more portentous sound and her lyrics for once don't shrink it down to something small and domestic.  Not great but solidly good.    11. \\""""Incomplete\\""""   3:30 (4/2 stars)  I don't know why but I really dislike the lyrics.  Feels like a song that was written for the sake of it as I can't imagine this being created out of pure inspiration.      I like to make EP playlists out of some albums on my iPod. Tracks 1, 3, 9 and 10 made the cut.",0

It's very dry, and suggests that a writer submits to all stylistic individuality being sapped out of them in favour of a deeply formulaic and simple, indeed hemmingway-esque, prose style. Still, not bad for understanding grammar and learning how to minimise padding in writing.",0
Boring The series should have been kept as a trilogy!!! By making it four books has just stretched it and the plot is awful I can't even finish the book! Won't buy the last one,0

"OVER RATED pretentious RUBBISH- I have NEVER read such a mind numbing pretentious pile of crap. I regret spending money on this book and wasting hours of my life trying to find an interesting paragraph.    How on Earth does this get such high ratings? come one people! This brings NOTHING to the dinner table...    And more seriously, How does this pretentious rubbish get published?",0

Five Stars good,1
Three Stars okay,0
Hyped I bought this album and their previous after reading some favourable reviews in the music press. Three things:    1. The guy cannot sing - he is off-key the whole time  2. ...which is utterly infuriating as the rest of the band are half decent  3. ...although they are a rather dull imitation of the Gin Blossoms from the early 90s.    I never throw CDs away - these two I binned after several days persevering. His voice is THAT bad.,0
"awful Well at least there is one good thing about this excuse for a book, It has finally cured me of buying so called sequels to classics.  There is no point in this book, the plot is flimsy, the characters cardboard with no resemblance to the originals and all in all a complete waste of money.",0
"Not bad... I brought this CD for a big one direction fan. I haven't listened to the song myself, as I was worried something might happen to the CD. So, therefore I will not be able to comment on that. They do have many other songs on the Cd, which is great! Instead of having one or two songs only. I was hoping it would come in a sealed packaged, but it didn't. I guess I cant do much about that. It would have given me the reassurance that its new and in good quality, even though I ordered a new copy.",0
Five Stars Thanks,1
"cute Went to the cinema to see this, surprisingly, I love it. Quite the opposite of what most people think of it haha.",1
"Sleeping Scriptwriter Felt it was a great cast and a good story idea, but the scriptwriter did not take enough time to build characters before moving on to the next one and so there was a distinct lack of interest in what was happening as you got to feel they would not be there long enough to care about. I know people who have run good films down because they have gone to make a drink in an important part of the plot and say they could not understand the film, well let them try it with this one. I did sit down and patiently wait for it to stop careering round like the bird who flies in ever decreasing circles, and we all know where that ended up!!!",0
"Pretty god damn amazing I love this album, works perfectly and I was very impressed with the quality of cd that came<br />Also came quickly",1
Five Stars excellent,1
"fun its good and fun, but sometims you dont get help from the them, you have to give them rate like me so you can get help, but its quite challenging and i love it, so far so good,",1
One Star Terrible,0
very addictive Great game very addictive,1
"Not bad, but not that good either I bought this book after reading The fault in our stars, also written by John Green (I highly recommend it by the way), but it was not nearly as good.<br />The story is alright but by no means unforgetable, and the characters lack credibility (I mean, 19 Katherines, really?).<br />I think I missed the point of the whole relationship formula Colin tries to develop. I feel like it didn't add much to the story.",0
"Noooo seriously? CGI Yoda = great edit  Obi-wan Shrill = sounds painful and unnecessary  Blinking ewoks = not a bad idea but after seeing the youtube, it almost looks like a glitch or just comes off as distracting.  Wasn't necessary.    \\""""Noooo\\"""" = so Lucas has taken the worst scene in RoTS and quite possibly one of the worst scenes in cinematic history and has put it at the climax of his trilogy.  Does it make a parallel with when Vadar turns bad and when he turns good with realization? Yes... is it a good change? DEFINITELY NOT.  It's like having someone tell you a terrible joke..and then trying to explain that joke so it gets worse.      The scene where Vadar finds redemption is pretty obvious and has a full sense of emotion.  Adding dialogue (and terrible dialogue at that) ruins the scene and for those who've seen the original, we end up laughing at how it sounds as oppose to having some sense that something epic is occurring on screen.    I had this pre-ordered and as a result all these changes, I've cancelled to join the many who want to make it a point that Lucas really doesn't need to change what's not broken.  Especially trying to turn the original trilogy into something remotely similar to the prequels (i.e. adding in aliens that maybe a child would enjoy but families and adults scoff at...aka. jar jar)",0
"Dont overthink its just a story I have just read the second book in this trilogy and like other reviewers will stick with it and read the final book. Most people are taking this far too seriously!! It is FICTION and I found it quite amusing in parts. That Ana comes out with such expletives as HOLY CRAP etc does become repetitive but she is a naive girl at the end of the day. Thought the first book Fifty Shades of Grey was a good enough story but did wonder how much more Ana could take literally and how this could be stretched over three books. You do go from liking Christian one minute to thinking him a ccmplete freakcake the second, but I think you do want it to turn out alright in the end. Makes a change to read a book like this instead of a gruesome murder book which is just as graphic but without the hype.people who have suffered domestic violence should not read it (they know what the story about as everyone been on about it) as it can come across as making light of a sensitive and horrendous subject.However, as my title suggests it is a story, and makes a change from alot of the drivel that is around at the moment.So I suggest read it and take it for what it is and probably enjoy it. By the way as always Amazon are cheaper than most outlets selling these books and arrives in a few days or in seconds without the wait on Amazon Kindle.",0
"Brilliant all round A great film. It was initially bought for the missus but I've made it my dvd. Good acting and a powerful story which is based on a true to life one. The delivery of the well protected dvd was quick, within a week of ordering it was mine. Packaging was well protective and the dvd works perfectly. Highly recommend!",1
"Five Stars All the best bits together, replaces several tape & vinyl albums",1
"The product was not new the product was clearly not new (beside it was sold as new). Was unpacked and the internal paper box is damaged on one edge, and also the vinyl is a bit scratched and damaged, fortunately not deeply but just superficial. It actually works and play without jumping, but I unfortunately I can't tell if the damages are influencing the sound, cause the equalization of the recording of this album is pretty s*** (I read in a lot of places and I can confirm it).<br /><br />edit:<br />I've contacted amazon and they've answered in a couple of hours offering me a refund of 50%. I thought was pretty fair for the conditions of the vinyl (which is definitely not new, but just superficially damaged).",0
"Highly over-rated In contrast to the millions who consistantly rate this as one of the top albums of all-time, IMO I think it, and Nirvana as a band, are one of the most highly over-rated - along with Radiohead.  But each to their own.",0
"Terrible , more of a comedy than horror. When i watched the first Insidious movie i quite enjoyed it, well Insidious 2 is a awful movie, it just is not frightening unless your a 15 year old who has never seen a horror movie before, James Wan the director has ripped off every horror movie in the book, The Shining, Amityville Horror, Poltergeist etc, you name it,<br />Insidious 2 is a mess of a movie and not once was i frightened, it is more of a comedy and i laughed, at times my eyes were closing and i had to wake myself as it was so boring.<br />My advice watch The Exorcist, the Amityville Horror, the Shinning these films will frighten you, stay away from Insidious 2, please don't waste your money on this terrible film!",0

Five Stars Fantastic album - not a weak song on it.,1
Four Stars Very good just like the &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;,1
Okay It is actually a great read - I was just not happy with its ending. But entertaining like the rest of the series.,0
Best Kept Secret Enjoyed reading about the family saga. Jeffrey Archer is a aster story teller and manages to keep the reader wanting more.,1
"Waste this was a waste of money in my opinion, the price isn't bad it's just the graphic side and the actual gameplay was a thumbs down. The graphics are terrible really disappointing, the controls on the game are unusual and not very clear and can be quite confusing, I have nothing against being blocked but most shots get blocked which really pushes me away from the game.",0
"Unnecessary I bought this book based on the recommendation from Scott Kelby's books only to be disappointed. I should have spent the money on something else. I honestly did not learn anything new. The way I see it, Mr Kelby only recommended the book because Joe and him were good friends and Scott wanted to help Joe sell his books. I should have checked the contents before snapping it up on Amazon.",0
"Not that much of a Decca Legendary 1963 affair. The better recording of the two piano concertos on this CD (which contains the Rachmaninoff No. 2 and No.3) is  the third piano concerto which is the earliest Ashkenazy (analogue) version made in 1963 with Fistulari/London symphony.<br />There is a restricted feel of excitement all over, not a very great fluent during playing and during the monumental climaxes.<br />Yet, the recording Ashkenazy made later at the dawn of the digital era with the Concertgebouw/Haitink, mildly surpassed this 1963 version on ground of agility, interpretation and recording merit.<br /><br />The second piano concerto on this ADD CD is a lame horse in that, that it has no real focus and no real sonic drive.<br />The sound captured here has many common denominators (second piano concerto) with the Third piano concerto - in that, that it is quite veiled, misty, has a larger than life piano presence that almost altogether cloaks the orchestral groups and buries them under the piano weight, no real &#34;see-through&#34;.<br />The later version of the second piano concerto made with the Concertgebouw has a better nuances, details, outlook on the sound-stage and it captured better the tonality and the instruments thereof.<br /><br />Continuously on this CD, there is softening of the frequencies from top to bottom and most disturbing is the bass attacks at the bottom octave as it is sorely missing, almost non existing; a bad thing it is as it robs the passages (mainly at the end of the third piano concerto) and other climax passages that serves as a springboard-take-off (diving) board for the piano to ride on - those instances are missing here or are greatly omitted, causing a diminishing drama, diminished drive and reduced excitement.<br />A comparison with the original version on LP (SXL 6057) proves that the bass-drum attacks were there to enjoy and for the heart to skip a beat, but in the digitizing whirl presented here with this &#34;legendary&#34;, those instances were reduced to almost nothing.<br />I would say that this bass entanglement is caused by misjudging miscalculations on behalf of the re-mastering team who for this or that reason thought to spare the playback system from a more dynamic full spectrum and realistic bass frequencies - a stupid decision.<br /><br />So, this &#34;Decca Legends 1963&#34; is not as legendary an affair after all, but a mediocre re-mastering that misses on many sonic and excitement points and instances.

Five Stars what is there to say to this series. out of this world,1
"Good price for the box Good price for the box, a bit of careful if you travel with books because of the quality. Ink quite thin, some worlds are like &#34;buffered&#34;. But if you don't want a collection box (just to read the books i mean) is ok.",1
"The worst of them all. I have always disliked this film. No matter how many times I try to watch it, I either dose off or get bored within half an hour.<br />Maybe it does get better towards the end, but you have to make it that far to find out.<br />As a major Batman fan though, let me tell you that if this is the only one you have seen; it gets a lot better. Watch the other 3 from this series. Or even the Dark Knight trilogy, 100 times better than this film.",0
Mistitles This is most definitely not the best of Eric Clapton - not by a long way.  It is a selection of his later work which I do not like at all.  I returned it.,0

"Great book at a great price Great book! Very cheap and well made. Once I started this series, I haven't been able to stop. A good place to start if you haven't seen the TV series, as I hadn't, but also a great read even if you have!",1
"Not good I bought this DVD as it's my favourite film and was very disappointed that when playing the DVD skips and misses out a lot of the film. I was assured that it was in very good condition, it wasn't :/ other than that this is a fantastic film and would reccommend it to anyone!",0
"books first! READ THE BOOKS PEOPLE. I'm sure that if you haven't read the books and just watched the film because it looked good or it was starring 'Hazel Grace Lancaster' then it is great. Unless you are a middle aged male of course. However, if you decide to do the right thing and read the books you will discover how brilliant they are and the film has RUINED that. It's left everyone thinking it's a copy of the hunger games and maybe the film is but the book certainly isn't.<br /><br />So, if you have or will read the books then I wouldn't suggest this film but if you aren't planning on reading them then sure, go for it. But the film is certainly not phenomenal or anything.",0

Compare that with the complete band that is now with the introduction of a Floor Jansen. Perfection!<br /><br />They were okay before with two singers who didn't really gel, now they are a fantastic tight unit. Buy this if you want to but listen to story time first and you will find absolutely no comparison, no cohesion and definitely no hairs standing up at the back of your neck when Floor takes to the stage as part of a band, not ax a weak voiced (in comparison) Diva.",0

"Appalling and awful film. Are there no 3D films worth watching? This had no plot, was completely devoid of entertainment, so much so that I wish I had gone to sleep.",0
"Not Quite How It's Supposed To Be This is one of my favourite Stones albums but the record company seems determined to neutralise my continued enjoyment. The 2009 remasters of the post-Decca/London studio albums (from 1971's Sticky Fingers to date) have come in for some stick in some quarters & rightly so; the one-EQ-setting-suits-all-tracks approach to 'remastering' was a creative mistake which simply did not suit some titles, with Some Girls suffering the most. The original release didn't sound like it was recorded in a tin can but the 2009 version did with the contents compressed to a degrading degree, stripping the original of its dynamic range. What used to sound nice & sleazy was transformed into something shrill & dense. I was hoping that this 'deluxe' issue might feature a decent second attempt at the job but, alas, no: this package contains exactly the same 2009 remastered version with no discernible attempt to improve the faulty sound. This is disappointing, to say the least. Some Girls deserves so much better than this. What is truly frustrating, however, is that the same does not apply to the bonus disc of out-takes. The sound here is excellent from start to finish- I'm not about to complain on that score because the 12 extra tracks are well worth hearing if you're interested in a collection of would-be B-sides in fine quality sound. But is it not ABSURD that the out-takes sound so much better than the album proper? This is not quite how it's supposed to be, is it? If you think I'm being a tad tetchy here, compare this version of Some Girls to the 1990s remaster & you'll hear what I mean. The difference in tonal range is striking. Hell, under normal circumstances I'd be giving Some Girls a five-star rating but this version succeeds only in making it sound like a 3-star album & that just can't be right. In fact, it's a bit of a crime in my book. Are we not entitled to expect it to sound better instead of worse? Has concern for musical quality been finally thrown out of the window? Worth buying for the out-take disc, though, which really does sound pretty good.",0
silly and legacy destroying was it the indiana we hoped for? no it was a complete waste of time. i mean the other films were brlliant with ancient items like the holy grail and such yet this one just goes too far ( Spoiler ) i mean come on interdementional aliens and flying saucers! its just stupid and spoils the series i wasted £5 at the cinema wont be wasting more buying it on dvd,0
"Cute little addition to the Harry Potter books Slim, sweet hardback with stylised illustrations by J.K. Rowling herself.  It's made up of five little fairy tales, each with a magical moral, with each tale followed by a short discourse by Albus Dumbledore.  The tales are traditionally styled and each quite different, while 'Dumbledore's' commentary is amusing and gives new insights into the world we already know from the Harry Potter series.  Rowling makes the wizarding world so plausible, it makes for a magical little read.  A nice accompaniment to the series, and benefits the Children's High Level Group to boot, which is just the icing on the cake!",0
"Shallow It was promising. I liked the story, thought it was a good idea. But I did not like the author's way of writing. I read the book but did not fall into it.",0
"Good Read The first book is a really good read. It was easy to follow and didn't seem to drag. After the 1st book, I didn't seem to be as interested. It could just be that it was begining to seem like it's never finish the nearly 2000 page book!<br /><br />Overall, I like it...but was a bit disappointed",0
"BRILLIANT This game is fantastic and as being a massive fan of final fantasy, I love it, the battles ain't always easy, which is a good thing as it makes you more determined to succeed and the story branches off through the game and you can choose different sides, smooth graphics, great combat system and tricky baddies, can't fault this game I've not finished it yet, but I'd definitely play it again to choose the different story path , so far through the game, I should have saved it on 2 different saves, which means it would have saved time ( remember to do that ) a really really good rpg, get it for the endless hours of gameplay, you don't have to rush it and there are secret places to visit to get the best weapons, but the bosses do get tougher, so make sure your well equipped with what you need and plenty of as the money to buy them is very good :)",1

Some of the things said are so predictable and cheesy they made me cringe, for example a female agent kills a woman by shooting her in the butt and then says given the way she was dressed the last time she had that much pain in her bumb she was probably getting paid for it. Cringe!! Might be better as a film?",0

"Humble genuis Hogwood, Manze, Bernardini : with a list a stars of baroque music like this, I was thinking that I will hear some firework ! Unfortunetely,it is not the case here. It'not the fault of Hogwood. He has his usual ardour. We can feel his energy. No, I think the main problem is the composer, Tomaso Albinoni, himself. He does not authorize madness in exhibition, in virtuosity demonstration, and alas, in excess. <br />So the (beautiful) violon of Manze stay as good as gold ! The latter try to put, in the concertos number 1, 4, 7 and 10 , the maximum of energy he could in the spirit of the music written by the composer; but we stay on our appetite. <br /> <br />The oboes of Bruine and Bernardini, which have a huge place in this program, are sweet but not astounding.  <br /> <br />The slow movements are very beautiful.  <br /> <br />So, this music is pleasant but do not expect virtuosity here. <br />",0

"Not so good A little disappointment: in my opinion there are only three great songs (Uprising, Resistance, MK Ultra), the rest leaves me cold. I can't understand those who declared this \\""""the best Muse album ever\\""""; my favourite Muse album remains 'Absolution'. On the other hand, the three songs I mentioned are really great, and this makes this album worth buying.",0

The book started out very slow and focused heavily on ... The book started out very slow and focused heavily on character development. Eventually this was compensated by the intensity of the plot. It gave a thoughtful insight to euthanasia/assisted suicide and revealed the factors that contribute to this option. It showed the hardships one feels when they are completely dependent on others and have no control of their life.,1
Tribalism dressed as Sophistication It was once the case the xenophobia in the US was seen as a religious phenomenon.  Now that myth is blown out of the water with this flag-waving table-thumping display of anti-religious tribalism.  Thank God not all atheists are as ill-informed and unreflective as Sam Harris.,0

A sequel story to Pride and Prejudice and an enjoyable episode to watch and have. This took a bit of getting used to at the start with imprinted  details of the definative version of Pride nd Prejudice with Colin Firth etc. but eventually when sorted out with the different cast it turned out to be quite a good story - apart from the fact  that the deadleg got away with it again.,1

"Hmmm, a really difficult one to review! I almost don't know where to start with this one!<br /><br />I'll start by saying that at first I was really surprised there were any 3 star ratings at all for this book.<br />I considered it a bit of a 'Marmite' in that I think you'll love it or hate it. But, the more I dissect it for the purpose of a review, the more I think it only deserves a 3 star rating because of the flawed writing style.<br /><br />So - why did so many people rate it higher?? Someone said of it 'The prose is magnificent, the subject matter horrendous, but compassionately and intelligently related.' Well, in my opinion it was certainly a good read - BUT I wouldn't of used the words compassionate or horrendous'. Not that I don't find the subject matter horrendous - of course it is, but the book was a little flat actually. It lacked totally drama. Metaphorically speaking, this book should be red and black was a dull grey.<br />I did find the writing style heavy going (massively overly-descriptive) and by the end of the book, I was starting to think that some  character's behaviour was somewhat unrealistic. However, there was a surprising twist at the end which I didn't see coming at all - that, I liked!!<br />I would recommend this book to others - but there are others I would recommend first.<br /><br />If you haven't yet read the book, don't read any further as I am going to allude to some events that occur near the end of the book and I don't want to spoil it for anyone.<br /><br />So - the book is written by the mother in the style of letters to her 'estranged husband'. I must admit, I am a bit of a sucker for plain old story telling and I think that these unusual / fancy styles of jumping back and forth through time through letters to a 3rd person are unnecessary - just tell the story!! (If it's a good enough tale, it'll stand on it's own 2 feet regardless). Anyway,  I did find the language used was verging on pretentious and descriptions of often insignificant objects or events were far too lengthy.<br /><br />The first 3rd of the book verged on boring actually. Not a lot happened and the point it was making (ie. that a couple decided to have a baby, she reluctantly gave up her self-made career and the baby was a naughty brat who she didn't bond with) could have been described in 20 pages, not 150! I felt myself sighing my way through hoping desperately that something of interest would happen. It didn't.<br /><br />Come the last 2/3rds - well, these were better (thank God!). I wanted to feel more empathetic to Eva but I felt that she was kind of transparent. When I read a good book, I feel that I 'know' the main character - I feel angst if they are hurt and joy when they fall in love - but with Eva - I felt nothing. This was a major shortcoming of Shriver's because it did get to the point where I almost didn't care what Kevin did next because I didn't care about his airy-fairy mother.<br />Then 'Dad the Dupe'. Didn't that phrase just sum it up a treat!!! The way Kevin's dad could not see what Kevin was up to when it was just staring him in the face just infuriated me. This was so unrealistic. Quite frankly, when I read he's been killed by Kevin too, I thought 'YESSS'!!<br />I mean - the parents did nothing when he poured acid in his sister's eyes ..... come on. P-lease!<br /><br />So  the end of the book and no, I didn't see the 'Dad and sister were killed too' coming, nor the fact he used his prize cross-bow. Nice little twists but not nice enough to make this book a 4 or 5 star offering!<br /><br />As for the ending - Kevin starting to panic a little about his actions - oh God, too little to late. I was hoping he might hang himself with his shoe-laces. That would of been a better ending!!!!verged on boring actually.

"The Last Precinct This is the 11th in Cornwell's long running Kay Scarpetta series and it is a complete extension of her previous novel '[[ASIN:075152543X Black Notice]]' which is the 10th in the series.  At the begining of this book we are thrust back into the mayhem following the night that Jean-Baptiste Chandone eg 'Le Loupe Garou' attempted to kill Scarpetta. Enter the usual cast of familiar faces; Marino & Lucy and we're off.  Unfortunately I found the first 100 or so pages pretty tough going as it all seems to focus upon Kay's therapy sessions with her dear friend Anna, whos house she is seeking refuge is after the police and the F.B.I. have begun work on the crime scene at her own house. Following this the pace begins to slowly get going but never really reaches either the pace or the climax as her earlier books.   Worth the read as part of the series but should definately not be read without previously reading 'Black Notice'.",0

"Too much hype not enough story After reading all the 5 star reviews about this novel I decided to give it a go myself. The different time lines can be confusing at first but once you get the hang of it after a few chapters its easy to follow. It's basically the story of an abusive relationship and the way it affected Catherine. The author gives us an in depth view of PTSD & OCD.  Not sure I liked the style of the before and after. The before took far too long to build up to the climax and the after, although well descibed became quite boring at times and was a bit over-cooked.  The story all comes together in the last third of the book and then we are treated to a successive timeline by the author. The flashbacks stop at this point.   It all became a bit predictable and I stuggled to finish it.  In my opinion absolutely not worth the 5 stars that most readers seem to have given. Having said that I am very difficult to please so maybe I've been a bit too harsh with my rating.",0
"Pointless This film promises a lot and had potential but didn't live up to it. Its not really about space its just basically Sandra bullock floating round space for 90 minutes crying and talking about how bad her life was, George clooney isn't in it for too long. Visually amazing but dull storyline that could of been way better. Not worth 90 minutes of your life",0
"Surprised so many persevered to the end. I was lent this by someone who liked it very much, and for that reason, I plodded on with it. The last hundred pages or so weren't so bad, but although the author has a fluid and careful written style, I felt the need for more signposts as to the novel's direction. It would have greatly helped to have been told that the novel was set during the Great Depression. There were a few political pointers, but they did not seem to lead anywhere. This was a characteristic of what I hesitate to call the story. I have not read much American fiction from this period, but am not inspired by this book to do so. It may be that if you live in the Southern USA and know towns  like  this, it connects more intimately with your experience. I was glad that I did not have to teach this book to a class, though I can see that  it would be well suited to examination study. I am left though with a few images, such as the girl sitting under a window listening to Beethoven on somone else's radio, then trying to recall the symphony in her head. The inside and the outside worlds. I would have liked to know more about the life of Singer, the hero, a mute., and whether he was Jewish or Turkish or just a mixture of Scots and Irish. Maybe the point of the book was to tell us in great detail about things we are not curious to know , while failing to elucidate the plot. Maybe the author felt life was like that?",0

"So so I have been a fan of Kates since the start. I have grown up with her. A few of her LP's have taken time to grow on me and on some I still skip tracks I mean that one on ariel about washing dirty clothes! I digress. I do not mind the piano basis or the exploration of the reoccuring themes, having heard her discuss this on Radio 4 I get where she was coming from.  Some tracks I really like a lot especially the one with Stephen Fry which is great fun, and also the one about the Wild man very Kate. However I feel she has missed another oppertunity, just like her last LP of rehashes. The first track has a haunting poem or lyric and I do not mind her son when he is speaking in fact I quite like that bit, how ever choir boys solos are not my cup of tea so I cringe when he starts singing albeit in tune. Then there is that odd song about a snowman in her bed erm what where you drinking Kate? Jury is still out on the duet with Elton John. I guess ideal for the Ipod cos I can download the tracks I like and ignore the rest",0

OK, as a standard reference book, a book to refer to when your asking \\""""I wonder how to\\"""" ?..

"Not my cup of tea. I was really looking forward to this book, I am not sure what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't this.  The writing is long and tedious, the locations limited and she seems to describe a single location multiple times and yet other instances when a description of the setting would be useful, just skims over it.  Many things seem to happen with little or no follow through or reasoning and I found myself struggling to believe many aspects.<br />Character development seemed to flick backwards and forwards as if the author couldn't quite decide how the characters should behave and reactions I would have expected from the character didn't happen making me question their behaviour previously.<br /><br />I am not sure why this book is called the Miniaturist because you could have quite easily removed the entire dolls house without changing the story.  I feel very let down that this plot line wasn't followed through and just seems to have been abandoned when the author got bored with it.<br /><br />I struggled through the book and only felt it actually got going in the last couple of chapters, meaning I was left feeling cheated that the book finished when I was finally interested.  It seemed to end as soon as there were some actually difficulties for the characters to face.<br /><br />I hadn't realised that Patronella Brandt was the real life doll house owner until after I read the book.  I feel quite insulted on her behalf.  The story in the book would have been tremendously salacious at the time and I can't imagine this woman would have approved at her name being tarnished in this way.  I agree with a previous reviewer that another name should have been imagined for this character.  It seems very disrespectful.",0

No book impressed me like &#34;Stoner&#34; did for quite a long time. This book definitely deserves to grow much more popular.<br /><br />Sensitively but plainly written, &#34;Stoner&#34; takes its readers through the life of William Stoner with all its disappointments, challenges and failure. It reflects and depicts the existence of humans as redundant, finite... in an almost agonizing manner it describes how simple decisions and actions make life to what it is.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that &#34;Stoner&#34; was  about to be lost and forgotten in the flood of less moving books.",1

"very poor quality I've been looking forward to this movie on 3D Blu-ray since i pre-ordered it. Yes it's an old film, and cheesey, but hey, we all like abit of cheese now and again. But i was appalled at the quality. The transfere to blu-ray wasn't just poor, it was a joke, and the 3D looked like it was a 2D version switched to 3D by my tv remote.<br /><br />I then put my original DVD 2D version on that i bought when Top Gun first came out on DVD, and it was better quality. The new Blu-ray was grainy and fuzzy, and quite frankly i couldn't watch it. So i'm returning it for a refund. I then put on one of my new Blu-ray 3D DVD's that i bought from amazon recently,OZ The Great and Powerful, and OMG! what a difference, everything about it is outstanding, the HD quality and sound, and the best 3D iv'e seen on any of my 3D movies yet.<br /><br />So Sorry Top Gun Blu-ray 3D you get a big thumbs down from me. I also noticed that it's price has dropped quite alot since i pre-ordered it at £19 it came down to £17.94 when it released, it's now £12.99. Says alot doesn't it.",0

"Great music - but not enough!!! Great tracks which I had heard in the series, so when I seen this CD I knew I had to get it, However it is rather on the short side. If this had been on vinyl it would all fit on one side of an album. More like an EP rather than a CD - and its Soundtrack Vol. 1 which suggests to me they are planning a Vol. 2. If so they should have waited and maybe put it all on one CD<br /><br />so great content - just not enough of it so hence 3 stars",0
"To Boldly Go Where We've Been Before First up, the problem: the first episode does not play between 5-7 minutes, stuttering and crashing on both my computer DVD player and on my TV DVD player. Either this is a copyright protection problem or Amazon had a bad batch, because they sent me replacements with the same problem, whilst seasons 2 and 3 from another vendor had no problems at all. Thus the loss of one star.<br /><br />The special effects are wonderfully done for this remastered series, of especial note the planets that the Enterprise orbits in each episode, which look far superior to even those produced in the more recent Star Trek series. Other special effects have been purposefully limited to keep to the original feel of the series, i.e. the ships and space stations still look like models even though they are computer generated, but they are more polished and detailed. The original materials, make-up and special effects used for alien beings have been kept largely the same, but with important touch-ups that retain the feel of the show whilst making it more digestible in our modern age of seamless integration between actors and fabricated aliens.<br /><br />The picture quality is far better than the original footage, although occasionally it appears a particular scene or camera shot was not touched up at all. Strange, but relatively minor.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the series, the main drawback is that many of the episodes are too similar, with the same idea or situation reworked in a different setting with different characters. But the interplay between the members of the crew, especially the main trio of Kirk, Spock and Bones, is wonderfully progressive even if the storylines sometimes fail to be.<br /><br />The show is also clearly influenced by the extreme liberal movement of the sixties, to the extent that you could be forgiven for believing that flower power never ended but was simply exported into space. There are also glaring eye sores in some of the episodes, such as alien worlds having exactly the same language, fashion and technological developments as English speaking countries on Earth, something that was mercifully corrected in later Star Trek series. There are also glaring inconsistencies with the timeline of events in the history of the Federation, compared to later Star Trek series, but these can often be overlooked.<br /><br />In summary the remastered effects have given a new burst of life to a show now 40 years old, and for the most part the episodes are still enjoyable, but unlike Star Wars, they are not timeless; the show still shows too much datedness in its writing and production for this reviewer to want to view these discs more than once, and thus the loss of another star. But they are a great way to relive old episodes that have been largely forgotten, one last time.anguage, fashion and technological developments as English speaking countries on Earth, something that was mercifully corrected in later Star Trek series.

Sorry, not a re-read. I bought all 3 books at the same time as I am a quick reader and really regret spending my money. Of the books, the first one was the best.

"About the Physical Content, not the movies. First of all, I am a great fan of Harry Potter and I love all the movies. This review here is not about the movies but of the physical content. I pre-ordered this on the day it was listed. I did so because Amazon stated that the 1st 1000 would be issued for pre-orders. thinking that I should try my luck and pre-ordered because i wanted the first 1000.  2 weeks after the release date, i noticed the price dropped about 5 quid, i wasnt happy but i thought it was ok since i was probably getting a lower number than the rest. Little did i know that was just the beginning of a series of disappointments.  When i finally received it 3 weeks after release, mine was numbered 7xxx. oh well i said i didnt have the luck. Then i read from other reviewers here and other forums that people who didnt preorder got numbers within the 1st 1000. someone even got one of those numbers from getting a replacement.   oh, and it arrived dented at the corner.  I was ready to request for a replacement and to my horror, it was out of stock.  I didnt want to miss out on an LE set so i had to keep it. Amazon refunded me 8quid out of \\""""goodwill\\"""". So technically speaking i paid 3 quid less than others for a damaged item.  In Future, I will investigate further to find out on the 1st 1000 before placing an order.",0

"Seemed more like a synopsis This one seems to me to have been written with a deadline in mind, and while there are obviously a lot of loose ends of human history to tie up after 1000 years, by the halfway mark, I honestly thought that was all the author was trying to do. The finish, with a threat of human destruction, is shoe horned into the last couple of chapters, the characters are utterly one dimensional and the whole thing leaves one wondering what Clarke could have achieved if he had put his mind to it. There are signs of a great and imaginative story here, which is something Arthur C Clarke has done so well, but this just feels like an outline for someone else to flesh out.",0
Five Stars Great,1
"Dull and lifeless Got this album on CD and love it!  Humble Me sends shivers down my spine.  Couldn't wait for the vinyl version, OH DEAR.<br />Flat and lifeless sounding.  What have they done to it!  Put on Eric Claptons Unplugged to make sure my system wasn't playing up and it wasn't. Who ever commited this to vinyl should take lessons from the people who commited Unplugged to Vinyl.  Or find other employment!",0
Anna Calvi I had read good things about this album and had heard her sing 'Jezebel' so perhaps my expectations were too high for I found it disappointingly ordinary.,0
"A musicians perspective  (if you're not a musician, scroll to the bottom of the review*******). I have only had this app a few days and I am already really enjoying it.  I have tried a few of the music making apps on the android system and most of them are mediocre at best.  My favourite android &#34;DAW-lite&#34; application used to be Magix Music maker, which is fine for putting together dance inspired tracks locked at 4/4.  If you want something a little more expressive, then I suggest you try this app.<br /><br />This app tops my expectations from what initially looks like a &#34;rhythm game&#34;.  If you think that nicely arranging multi-coloured blobs (or &#34;nodes&#34;) in an arrangement to get music sounds simple, then on the face of it, it is.  That makes it quite accessible to those who are not hugely musically minded but still want to make something that sounds quite tuneful.  Within a few seconds you're able to drag and drop the &#34;nodes&#34; into the play space and connect them to make some kind of &#34;tone collection&#34;.  There are a selection of nodes at your disposal and these can be arranged in a multitude of ways to create something either melodic or hypnotic.  There are three sets of notes - -the large round ones (a chord generator), the large square ones (a rhythm generator) and 7 differently coloured small round ones (&#34;notes&#34;)<br /><br />When you open the app, you are given a chance to either listen or play.  The listen mode seemed reasonable but that's not what why I downloaded the app.  I wanted to start throwing the nodes about and see what I could &#34;produce&#34;.  There are a multitude of options to play around with, which should be familiar to anyone who is used to using a sequencer or synth.  Attack, decay, resonance (echo) are all available as options to be tweaked which can (for the uninitiated) affect how fast your notes are sounded, how long they sound for and then how long they take to fade out.  All pretty standard fare.  Chuck in a selection of waveforms from sine to sawtooth and you can start to create some sounds that might not be out of place in a late 70's/early 80's John Carpenter movie.<br /><br />Just as you start to think you don't have enough options, you can then start to do many other tricks that would be familiar to those who use programs like Fruity Loops.  With beat sync and note duration (quaver, semi-quaver, breve and minim) it is easy enough for those who like to get more in depth  with their beats have that extra control.  There are a few more options I haven't gotten to yet, but as a musician with a bit of experience with computers I was very impressed with what I found under the hood so far.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention the background keyboard and the full chromatic scale with 4 note polyphony?  Did I mention the selection of scales and modes (some of which I can't even play on a real instrument, yet) that are available? Oh, did I also mention the node on/off bit?<br /><br />*******For the non musical who like rhythm games?  Okay, while this app is accessible to you and I can recommend this app with pleasure to you, there are bits I have mentioned that might pass you by.  To you I say this - have you ever wondered what the constellation of Orion sounded like?  This app will tell you.  Have you wondered what a cat could sound like if it was hybrid with a synth?  Well, just for giggles I thought I would try that out too.  Yeah, this is where the really cool stuff happens.  Using &#34;coloured blobs&#34; you can make nice little pictures like a stick man or a cat face and have nice relaxing (or banging) tunes which manage to look pretty cool and sound amazing.  That alone is worth it.<br /><br />TL:DR - Buy it, it's too good to miss and what I didn't enjoy about it I have forgotten about while enjoying it.",1
Five Stars Fantastic album. Airbourne are the modern equivalent to ACDC only better.,1

"A missed opportunity. After all the hype about this film I was disappointed because it turned out to be so bland. The characters are shallow to the point of barely being relevant to the plot, Jennifer Lawrence is very pretty and doesn't disgrace herself but then she doesn't have a lot to do. Woody Harrelson does a good job of being Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland as the arch villain is as menacing as candy floss. The romance is not romantic, the drama is not dramatic, the violent confrontation is only hinted at. Gladiatorial sci-fi it is not. For a film based on young people slaughtering each other for the amusement of others the scariest things in it are the fashion sense of the rich people and the fact that the poor people have to eat squirrels. Bless. The ending is so bad I can only assume it was tagged on at the last minute as an introduction to the next film in the franchise. The fact that it has a 12 rating speaks volumes. (I assume it has a 12 rating because that is the age group it's aimed at.) 'The Hunger Games' could have been special but it was watered down into something inconsequential. A missed opportunity.",0
"A GAME OF THRONES THIS AUTHOR IS NOT, OF COURSE, TOLKIEN'S HEIR. While with Tolkien you feel a wide range of feelings, positive feelings, you can not with this story that hides a lot of pederast material and coward violence. In other words, if you want to ENJOY a fantastic story whith dragons, and other fantastic creatures and mixed whith history don't buy this book. I threw it with its second sequel to the dustbin after reading a bit more than a quarter of the first volume. It was enough. Definitely nothing to do with the master of the epic adventure literature.<br />Excuse my English. I'm still learning.<br />This is the first time a write a review. But I hope that someone will find it usefull.

Seriously the worst film Tim burton ever done without a doubt,0

"good fun but some bad points It's a really fun game to play but there were one or two bad things. The first one: coins are really hard to earn and I paid my five coins to start at the residential area but then an arrow directed me to a cannon and fired me back to gru's lab and it continued to start from there. I felt a bit cheated out of my coins. The second one: it only does you how to defeat vector once and I forgot how to do it. I tried looking for it in the help pages but it wasn't there so now I can't defeat vector. Apart from that, a fun game to play!",0

Bought this alongside the 15 minute meal book to encourage the whole family including teenagers to participate more. However, they find the recipes rather fiddle and time consuming, cya inky not really achievable in 30 minutes but they are good a starting point. Wouldn't buy for anyone else.",0

"... been a fan of Nicole I can't believe how bad this album is Having been a fan of Nicole I can't believe how bad this album is. Most of the tracks are monotonously samey, the lyrics at times indistinct and nothing at all inspires me to give this album a second hearing. The slow tracks loosely called ballads do not do her voice justice, she sounds as if she's mumbling them whilst standing in the middle of a jungle and even the lyrics in the supporting booklet at times seem to bear no relationship to what she appears to be singing. I strongly suggest she finds a new lyricist and arranger and quickly brings out a better album with more upbeat and catchy tunes .If not, this album will surely see her exiting the music scene very quickly.<br />  I would quite definitely vote this worst album of the year.",0

"Disappointing. After reading so many excellent reviews, I thought this was for me, but I found it to be quite boring, also the music accompaniment was depressing, much of the films content I had seen similar  before, I believe this film would have benifited from some kind of dialogue, I would think that a lot of hard work had gone into the making of this film, but I feel it could have been better,get rid of the music, and make it into a documentary, the two stars is for the Blu-ray HD content, which is brilliant.",0

"Had this been his first book.. .. then I probably wouldn't have bought any of the others. Having read all the other Jack Reacher books, and been enthralled by every one, &#34;Personal&#34; was a huge disappointment. It rambles through a mediocre plot with no twists or surprises along the way. It feels as if Lee Child is compelled to have to carry on writing in the same manner that past-their-best singers release a jaded album.",0
"bought it for my father's birthday thinking year of his birth I bought it for my father's birthday thinking year of his birth he'd like it but no.  He just said it's all about America!  So, I read it.  It did contain a lot of information I didn't know but it was too rough and coarse for me although tongue-in-cheek.  I don't think I'd read another.  The most interesting bit was about Wickham and the origins of rubber plantations in Malaya.",0
Must read if you`ve read the first and second book but... this isnt the best one. Catching Fire was the best imo. This was good but the war part of it dragged a lot so much happened at once then nothing... the ending was rushed but sweet.

Worst season of a poor series Worst season of lost all that build up for that ending that you could of guessed after season 2/3 tops.

The whole of lost could of been done in 3/4 seasons but they just done six because there was far too many filler episodes. Do yourself a favour stick to HBO shows,0

I like Merlin a lot but was very disappointed with how the last episode ended. It was all going very well, but i thought how Merlin told Arthur that he had magic was poor, as well as how they killed Morgana off. Merlin simple stabbed Morgana in the back when she wasn't looking, there could of been many better way of killing her, it all felt a bit of a rush- like they only remember they had to kill her off at the very last minute. It felt the same about how Merlin told Arthur he had magic. Though the rest of the episodes were as good as quality as anything. Like i said 'Good Series, Poor Ending.",0

Great picture, amazing sound, so I thought I would upgrade to Blu-Ray.  Instead of improving matters, it made them wose.  I had some trouble with the picture freezing and some skipping.  Worse still, the sound is not as good as it was on the DVD.  The music lacks the extra little spark it had on the other format.  I still love this concert, any fan of A-Ha should own it and every non-fan should see it, but as far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, I feel I wasted my money.  I'm going back to the DVD.",0

"Too much D.I.Y. As always, let's go through the whole book:    Part  I. Intro  Bla-Bla-Bla Military Bla-Bla-Bla New underwater record bla-bla-bla...  Okay, fair enough, if the author wants to show off a little bit, I don't actually mind.    Part II. Nutrients  This is a pretty good part of the book, explaining the ways in which you should shift your food consumption in order to get the best results, why you will be doing exactly these exercises and not pump up your favorite dumbbell, metabolic rate and all other stuff. No objections to this part.    Pat III. The Exercises  This is where it gets tricky. It says \\""""Bodyweight exercises\\"""" on the cover, but let me tell you what else it requires:  - a pretty stable door with handles at your waist height  - a towel which will suffer great punishments  - Books  - rucksack  - chair (and another one!)  - an object to jump on, which will not fall after that and be at your knee height  - something about waist level to hold for balance  - something to hold onto and hang your entire body from it  - two objects of equal height equal to your waist and an extremely solid broom   - something heavy fixed to the ground, which you can hold  - a smooth, hard floor  - Two stable surfaces that are, or can be positioned a couple of feet apart, and strong enough to support your full weight AND equal in height AND at least waist height (quoting the book)    and so on.    So don't be fooled by \\""""using-only-your-body\\"""" exercises. If you do possess all those things - great. But as a student who lives in a relatively small room, I found it extremely disappointing.    However, there's something more important:  I. ALL these exercises can be done in a gym  II.It is waaaaaay easier to do this exercises in a gym - they do have FIXED, SOLID EQUIPMENT, which you don't have at home.    I mean, come on, pulling yourself up to a broom lying on two speakers?! First, it's easier to do it in a gym with a usual barbell bench and the barbell plank itself. Second, IT'S SAFER TO DOIT IN THE GYM.   This book goes into Do It Yourself stuff over the top. Can you make a barbell bench at home? Certainly, you break off the door of your wardrobe, then saw off four legs of a chair, glue them together, find a broom, put two rucksacks full of vegetables on both ends...    Don't waist your time on that :) wanna do it properly - do it in the gym.",0

"One CD Would Have Been Enough I'm not sure where all the references to disco music and Giorgio Moroder are coming from, but I suspect it's from a generation who have been suddenly exposed to the power of analogue synthesisers through the medium of Arcade Fire.

"Something wrong with the press of vinyl I received the lp in a perfect staste of conservation, but unfortunately there must have been some problem during the manufacturing of the record: third track side 2 was badly pressed, so the pick up skips and  always plays the same verse of the song. These problems may occure when you buy vinyl  and the seller hasn't have nothing to do with that. I'm sure we may keep on havin good business in the future.I want to keep the record anyway and still say thank you for your kindness and skill",0

"Manu Chao loses his way! After a long wait, Manu Chao's latest release is quite an anti-climax.  There are a number of elements that will probably grate with many of Chao's more discerning followers:     1. Unrelenting rock drums -  I find these really obtrusive and my guess is that these are intended to help beef up his live shows a la stadium rock: in my opinion they are really unnecessary, and indeed go against the fundamental grain of Manu Chao's song-writing sensibilities.     2. Sirens - don't get me wrong, I love imaginative use of electronic sounds and love the way Manu Chao's previously used them on past albums, but the use of these in this instance is overly repetitious and mindless and simply does nothing to enhance the music.      3. Other monikers are frequently recycled to a degree that almosts insults the listener.  To do it subtly and sparingly can be an artform as previously perfected by Manu Chao.  However, well before the end of this album you are left thinking \\""""what is he going to recycle next?\\""""; it's almost that predictable!      4.  Loss of the sense of fun and spontaneity: the rock aspect of the album comes across as over-produced clutter, relegating Manu's true forte, the often cheeky and charismatic simplicity of his songs, to the background.  The superimposition of a stadium rock template really is a case of trying fit a square shape into a triangle!     All said though, this isn't actually a bad album which does have its moments, but it's just not a very good one either.  It's clearly been over-hyped and is the product of a man whose creative energies have been overwhelmed by those of an industry looking to extract every last dollar by catapulting him, willing or not, further into the mainstream.      As an intro for people whose tastes lean towards rock, this probably isn't a bad start point to Manu Chao's work: they can rest assured that his previous studio albums will only improve their Manu Chao experience!",0
"Average but better than 'The Da Vinci Code'... Having now read all four of his books so far, this is probably Dan Brown's equal second best effort to date. Controversially, his worst book for me is still 'The Da Vinci Code' - a tremendously boring novel made into an even more tedious movie. Decent enough story though the other Brown stories are, I can't see enough meat in any of them to justify spending tens of millions of dollars filming further movies of his novels.<br /><br />Dan Brown is in a very fortunate (for him) position indeed in that he's now become one of the most famous authors in the world despite having only very limited storytelling skills, based on the strength of just one inexplicably best selling novel. His novels are merely 'okay' if you get round the constant niggles that in the world of Dan Brown, people are murdered wholesale on the most basic of premises via his highly predictable 'paint by numbers' style of thriller writing.<br /><br />So overall, I found this better than 'The Da Vinci Code', perhaps equal to 'Digital Fortress' but far behind 'Angels and Demons' which still wasn't a great book either!",0

"A must read Fooled by Randomness is a great book for anyone interested in Finance, Quantitative Finance, Trading, the Financial Markets or even interested in simple explanations of the most important concepts of statistics that apply to everyone's life. Most people in the financial industry, even at very high levels, do not know and/or understand some of the most basic concepts explained in this beautiful book.<br /><br />You can easily read random chapters of the book without having to follow the whole story and it should give you a unique perspective in life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all of Nassim Taleb's book are starting to look alike, so I would recommend only buying this one.<br /><br />The elements exposed in the books are easy to understand by everyone and do not require any specific mathematical or statistical knowledge as it explains broad concepts rather than detailed equations -- Bravo to Nassim for the angle he takes throughout the book, which makes it understanble by anyone.<br /><br />I read maybe 2 books a year as my reading speed is slow and my interest quickly lost -- yet, I would highly recommend this book to be read, even if it represents 50%-100% of the books you will read this year.",1

"A good and fascinating story - it's a shame it's largely false If you want a politically correct explanation why it was Europeans and not East Africans who colonized the world, then this is a must for you. If you're just interested in that question, you might also want to read this, but be warned. Much of his thesis is not tenable in light of newer evidence, and Diamond actually had to leave out or grossly misinterpret evidence available at the time of writing.<br /><br />His explanation is that biologically there's not much difference between say New Guineans and Europeans (except for the better immune system and lower intelligence of the latter), and that geography could explain most of the variation in human achievement. Now geography might indeed be important, but in more ways than he is willing to acknowledge. E.g. he is not even discussing the role of larger population sizes on evolution (larger populations produce more useful mutations than small ones), the role that large open continents played in evolution (not only ideas and inventions, but also useful alleles can cover the distance much better, thus peoples living in the largest continent might have received not only many more ideas and inventions and seeds from neighboring peoples but also many more useful alleles), or the fact that agriculture created an environment radically differing from that of hunting-gathering environment, which must have had strong selection pressures. (Although, of course, he could not have known the newest findings on the matter, evidence of very strong selection and very strong physiological as well as probably psychological differences between Mesolithic and present-day populations. Still some of the findings were already known, and I find his treatment of the topic too tendentious.)<br /><br />Just an example of the tendentiousness of his explanations: he muses about the New Guinean highlanders being probably more intelligent than Europeans. He bases this on his impressions on his New Guinean friends. Never mind that his friends could be the most intelligent highlanders (e.g. the leader of a cargo cult) who in any case want to befriend an alien. Never mind that there is (and already was at the time of his writing) a vast literature showing that Africans and other indigenous peoples around the world show remarkably low intelligence on IQ tests. (The reasons for this are and were debated, so one might argue this is not genetic, but environmental. But still, if he is willing to mention that he thinks Europeans are less intelligent than others, why did he not mention that this is a case of his impressions vs. IQ tests?) He also doesn't sound too convincing when he mentions one of his anecdotal evidence, a leader of a cargo cult. He remarks that this person was very intelligent to ask a question that most Europeans never even ask: that is, why is it that \\""""cargo\\"""" (products of technology including ships and airplanes) are only carried to New Guinea by Europeans and not the other way around? (One might answer that most Europeans of course would ask the question was it not verboten by political correctness...) Now he also mentions that the cargo cult leader thinks the Europeans have better magic. And of course he thinks Europeans explanations to the origins of technology (like factories and science) are only deceptions. Now it seems to me that the question this cargo cult leader asks might be intelligent, but his answer to that is not very intelligent. Asking a question that an intelligent child might ask is not a sign of supreme intelligence, only if one's expectations about these people are already comfortably low.<br /><br />Another example is his claim that China was on the verge of an industrial revolution in the 13th century... far from it. They were on the verge of inventing the steam engine, but the industrial revolution is far more than the steam engine. I'm not to deny the genius of the Chinese people in inventing so many useful practical inventions (not to mention their later track record of successfully adapting modern technologies), but they lacked science in the modern sense of the world. Chinese scientists never (never before contact with the West, that is) strived to find out new theories or to disprove received wisdom. Au contraire, they were extremely traditionalist. Therefore, the invention of the steam engine could not have led to an industrial revolution, if only because after a few decades the industrial revolution needed modern science, which they lacked. (It's also worth noting that many of the first great inventors had good knowledge of theoretical science, James Watt being a case in point. A tinkerer he might have been, but a tinkerer with a sound theoretical knowledge of the science of his day.)<br /><br />I think that some of his theories might have something to them (including his explanations on the role geographical fragmentation might have played), but he vastly overstates his point. Six years ago I found it fascinating (I didn't have problems with the repetitions other reviewers are complaining about), but now I think he didn't set out with an open mind to answer his question, but rather he just wanted to find the proofs for the conclusion he had already reached when he had set out. I would propose to read [[ASIN:0465020429 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution]] before (or instead of) this.",0
"Worst album since Eat Me This is Eat Me Drink Me territory.<br />Slow, dull and... Bland.",0
"Deja Vu The fundamental problem with Tool in 2006 is that they sound exactly like Tool in 2001. 10,000 Days sounds exactly as you would expect it too, like Lateralus, but more drawn out. Indeed, this record shows such a predictable similarity to Lateralus that you'd be forgiven for thinking all the songs came from the same sessions. The problem for Tool is the same that has befallen other bands with such a formulaic signature sound. The common thread for The White Stripes, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against The Machine and Deftones is that while they have produced some great records they also could be imitated so easily, often by themselves. That's not to say that 10,000 Days is poor, but simply nothing new. This feels too much like Tool-by-numbers, or more perfectly put by TinyMixTapes, \\""""Soy Tool.\\"""" Adam Jones sounds disappointingly derivative, even if out of context each song sounds decent enough. It is an uncomfortable feeling when a Tool song reminds you of Godsmack, Disturbed or Frogstomp era Silverchair. There are some real highlights however - the track 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) is as good as anything on Aenima, and Danny Carey's drumming is as stellar as ever. The real problem is where do they go next?",0

"A Huge Disappointment - Very Dull This is a review of the Audio Book which is 10 hours and 10 minutes long - I listened to it all!!<br /><br />Sheila Mitchell who read the book did a good job  - her voice was just right - I cannot fault it -  pity it was such poor material.<br /><br />I have read many of P D James books and liked them very much.  I have also listened to some as Audio books and like these too - so I was hoping for a very good story.<br /><br />I love Jane Austen and have read everything she has written including some short pieces she wrote when she was a very young girl.  Of all her novels Pride & Prejudice is my favourite and have read it more than 4 times and I have seen various adaptations on stage, on TV & on film.<br /><br />When Jane Austen writes she conveys so much in a few carefully chosen words and her writing is so full of humour.  Sadly - this had TOO MANY WORDS, NO HUMOUR and a VERY DULL PLOT.<br /><br />It was hardly a detective story for the listener as we did not have any clues to ponder over and wonder what might have happened.  For the first time I wished I could have listened to an abridged version.<br /><br />Far too much time was spent in scene setting and explaining who was who and who had done what - if you have read Pride & Prejudice then this was too much - just not needed - nothing really happened in the first 3 hours of listening.<br /><br />The story is set 6 years after Elizabeth and Darcy married and there are preparations in hand for a Ball at Pemberley - it is a stormy night and a chaise appears with Lydia (Elizabeth's sister)as the passenger - she stumbles out screaming that her husband (Wickham) has been murdered ..... it could have been so good but it was just a huge disappointment.<br /><br />I had wanted to like this but I cannot recommend it at all.",0
"A disappointing book from a normally great author I've always enjoyed McEwan's novels, and was looking forward to On Chesil Beach, and the unusual idea of all the action taking place on a wedding night. But although the writing was wonderfully evocative in places, I was deeply disappointed, as the premise and plot were so slight that there was nothing to hold my interest. It felt rather lazy on the part of the author, and I barely cared enough about the two main characters to keep reading. On Chesil Beach feels more like an experiment than a novel, and for me, it wasn't one that succeeded.",0

"Jamie says: the meals in this book are the same cost or mostly cheaper than to buy in a restaraunt or takeaway. hmmm Yes, meals work out mostly tasty, but if I knew that often the suggestion to make a meal quick and tasty means to buy the best quality rump steak and lots of free-range chicken fillets, bagged salad and rice pudding from a &#34;chilled section&#34;, then I wouldn't have bought it, because of course you can make a quick and delicious meal if you throw lots of money at the problem: eat steak or nice flash-fried slab of fish from fishmonger with salad every night, and ice-cream for dessert :). When I was reading the intro what got me worried was Jamie's saying &#34;I costed these meals against their equivalents on the high street and it turns out that MOST of them are actually cheaper to make from scratch than they are to buy from your local takeaway, restaraunt or ready-meal supermarket aisle&#34;. That didn't sell it to me at all, so I'd have to spend time and energy sourcing the ingredients, cooking, serving and washing up and may end up spending more than in a restaraunt :(<br /><br />The first thing I cooked was a meal with spinach and feta pie as a main, here is the list of ingredients for you to see how  expensive it might work out, I'll use mysupermarket to average the prices out between Asda and Ocado at the time of writing:<br /><br />100 g pinenuts(that's about £3)<br />5 eggs (about £1)<br />300 feta cheese (at least £2+)<br />50g cheddar cheese (say 40p)<br />dried oregano (10p)<br />1 lemon (35p)<br />a knob of butter (10p)<br />400 g prewashed baby spinach (baby spinach usually sold in 100-150 g, so will work out at at least £2.6-2.7, or £4 if you buy 4 bags in my local supermarket - waitrose; of course I used &#34;non-baby&#34; spinach which was still over £2)<br />270g pack of filo pastry (approx.£1.65)<br />cayenne pepper, whole nutmeg<br /><br />So £11 just for the ingredients, then all the faffing about making it (it was quite faffing), then washing up. Husband and kids weren't that impressed with the pie, so it felt no good value for moneyat all.<br />Pudding from the same menue - typical pudding, I must say, there is a lot of ice-cream and double cream in puddings<br />COATED ICE CREAM<br />4 tablespoons coffee beans<br />100 g hazelnuts<br />100g good quality dark chocolate<br />good quality vanilla ice-cream.<br />You basically whizz first three ingredients in a blender and then coat the ice-cream in it<br /><br />As somebody else remarked, if I were eating puddings like that every single day (I find good-quality ice-cream rich enough, without smothering it in nuts, chocolate and coffee) I would weigh a ton by now!<br /><br />Some more examples of ingredients for puds:<br />TRIFLE<br />3 oranges<br />75 ml limoncello<br />100 g sponge fingers<br />250 g mascarpone<br />2 heaped tablespoons icing sugar plus extra for dusting<br />100 ml milk<br />1 lemon<br />1 teaspoon vanilla paste<br />1 punnet of raspberries or other seasonal fruit<br />1 100g bar of good quality dark chocolate<br /><br />GANACHE<br />2x100g bars of good quality dark chocolate<br />a large knob of butter<br />300 ml single cream<br />3 clementines<br />12 palmiers or other nice biscuits<br /><br />AFFOGATO<br />1 tablespoon instatnt coffee(or 4-6 shots of espresso)<br />3 teaspoons golden caster sugar<br />4-6 round shortbread biscuits<br />425g tin of pitted black cherries in juice<br />100 g good quality dark chocolate<br />500 g tub of good quality vanilla ice-cream<br /><br />THICK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE<br /><br />2x100g bars of good quality dark chocolate<br />a small knob of butter<br />2 tblspoons of golden caster sugar<br />300 ml double cream<br />1 teaspoon vanilla paste<br />2 large eggs<br />a splash of brandy, Baileyes, Grand Marnier or Argmagnac<br />cocoa powder for dusting<br />1 orange, clementine or a handful of strawberries<br /><br />To be fair not every menu features a pud, and a few of them a fruit and berry based. But most puddings cost and richness wise are a special occassion treat for me, not a weekday dinner end of meal. The same cost-wise must be said about most of mains, esp. when they are based on &#34;the best quality rib-eye&#34;, &#34;the best quality rump&#34; steaks etc, I have four children so buying pounds of best quality rib-eyes steaks would probably use up the budget of my weekly food shop in a couple of days. As I said in the beginning, if I had heaps of money I wouldn't need culinary books, my quick meals would be steak-fish-salad 5 days a week, and at the week-end we'd go out :)<br /><br />That's the main reason this book hasn't worked for us. The fact that even with practise most meals take nowhere near 30 min has been mentioned by everyone already! I am using this book for ocassional dish here and there, and sometimes for dinner parties, it's just not an everyday quick meal solution for me.",0

"An over-winded review... It just wouldn't be a Garbage release if it didn't come with a delay. Almost 3 years after a Best Of was announced, it finally saw the light of day earlier this year. Many fans speculated that the delay was the result of Warner putting their work in to make a comprehensive set for the fans - rumours of complete b-sides and music video collections, as well as a live CD/DVD box set began to surface. The end result can't help but leave any long-term Garbage fan under-whelmed and confused about the 3 year gap.    The bonus disc of remixes is, bar a few exceptions, a waste of a perfectly good blank CD that would have been better suited to home a selection of their 40-odd b-sides. There are occasionally some genuinely cool re-workings - namely U.N.K.L.E.'s 'The World Is Not Enough', Massive Attack's 'Milk' and Fun Lovin' Criminals 'You Look So Fine' - but the majority of the disc is pretty much your typical club trash.    You can look at the singles disc in two ways: from the perspective of a long-term fan, or as someone who liked a few songs back in the day but who never bothered buying one of their albums.    With the exception of 'Shut Your Mouth', the album focuses entirely on their US single chronology - meaning even the UK edition of the album features the U.S.-only '#1 Crush' while ignoring any of their international singles like 'The Trick Is To Keep Breathing', 'Breaking Up The Girl', 'Sex Is Not The Enemy' and 'Run Baby Run'. As it stands, the first twelve tracks on the compilation come from the era's surrounding their [[ASIN:B00013R89W Garbage]] and [[ASIN:B00014EIRG Version 2.0]] albums, while their last 2 albums are each represented by only 2 songs. The inclusion of some of those later titles would have helped balance the compilation out a bit and also improve the quality of the record as a whole. 'Why Do You Love Me', although their biggest hit in years (UK #7, and their first song to appear on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart since 1998), is by no means one of their better songs and is easily surpassed by the two [[ASIN:B0007QCII4 Bleed Like Me]] singles excluded from the record.    But for the casual listener, the album does its job. Late 90's radio staples \\""""Queer\\"""", \\""""Only Happy When It Rains\\"""", \\""""Stupid Girl\\"""", \\""""Push It\\"""", \\""""I Think I'm Paranoid\\"""", \\""""Special\\"""" and \\""""When I Grow Up\\"""" are all present. Also worth pointing out is the neat little habit Garbage had back in the day of actually releasing the best songs from their records as singles. Album closers \\""""Milk\\"""" and \\""""You Look So Fine\\"""" (from 1995's Garbage and 1998's Version 2.0, respectively), while they would have never reached the chart heights of \\""""Stupid Girl\\"""" or \\""""I Think I'm Paranoid\\"""", were none-the-less released as singles and became minor hits. The inclusion of these seldom-remembered but beautiful songs will without fail knock your jaw to the floor on first listen, much like they did mine, and convince any newcomers that this is a band worth exploring further. And, correct me if I'm wrong, that's the whole point of a Best Of? In that respect, this is a job well done.",0

"Pretty good Maybe I should give this a half star extra? I dunno. I liked this book. Considering how much hype it's gotten I thought it was definitely worth checking out. And I went in with pretty much the lowest expectations ever because the paranormal genre is usually not my thing. I suppose that probably helped.<br /><br />The biggest flaw that I can think of that no moment really \\""""blew me away\\"""" or whatever. I'd seen spoilers - so the ending revelation about Jace was nothing new to me. I am interested to see how that will be resolved - since I already sort of know that too. Ugh spoilers. And yeah, I guess the \\""""shocker\\"""" about Clary's father also wasn't surprising to me - I guessed that within the first few chapters.<br /><br />It was enjoyable to read though. The writing, the prose, it's solid. Really good. Much better than some of the other YA crap I've been muddling through. Just. Third person. Thank god. It reads so much better for me. It was action packed, so it was hard to stop reading I suppose.<br /><br />I'm not normally a fan of love triangles, but this one got me. In the first few chapters Simon is so charming I was totally \\""""awwww\\""""-ing at him. And I appreciate that with Jace it wasn't instalove. It was actually a pretty damn good build up. I dunno, it's actually a love triangle that's got me sitting on the fence, hahaha. So mission accomplished I guess, Cassandra Clare, good job! xD<br /><br />Clary as a main character is sufficiently enjoyable. She is relatively strong, considering all she has to deal with in this novel. She's not constantly thinking about boys, thank god. I absolutely LOVE that she's an anime fan. To put that in your main character. Major props. Thank you for making it clear that not all anime fans are freaks. And I appreciate that Trigun reference at the end. That was good. Very good.<br /><br />Jace is pretty dreamy. Simon is adorable. Luke is cool.<br /><br />...And, yeah. Better love story than Twilight. But that's not hard is it?<br /><br />I look forward to continuing the series :)<br /><br />Recommended for: fans of paranormal romance.look forward to continuing the series :)<br /><br />Recommended for: fans of paranormal romance.",1

"My Rating for the new EH song (not album) version of Valleys Of Neptune Having now heard the new pro-tooled version of Valleys Of Neptune it sounds bloody awful IMO and is a shorter version of the version we older fans are familar with, no brilliant flamenco guitar solo like the edited version on the lifelines album, in fact NO GUITAR SOLO AT ALL!! it also fades out so we are missing the good ending, the original is 5.39mins and this new 'Butchered' version is about 4mins long, terrible IMO and it sounds like Jimi is hitting 'bum' notes in the intro :(     My advice seek out the original to hear the true genius of this song instead of this bland boring play it safe version!! I hope the rest of the album has not been given the same treatment, because it is starting to sound like a Douglas era Crash Landing/Midnight Lightning album concept:(",0

"Back to the future Ralph Fiennes gives an impressive performance as sleazy ex-cop Lenny Nero in Kathryn Bigelow's entertaining SF noir action thriller set in the near future. Nero is Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe transposed to anarchic Los Angeles at the turn of the century, a flawed, fallen honourable man somehow living with his demons and surviving by trading in SQUIDs or ‘Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices’, which attach to the skull and transmit brain waves enabling the wearer to experience another person’s recorded reality. When Lenny acquires a recording of the gruesome death of his friend Iris he decides to investigate, but he is no all-action hero but an emotionally wounded wreck of a man, befriended and protected by Angela Bassett’s sleek tough limo driver and Tom Sizemore’s street-wise private detective (wearing an alarming Meat Loaf wig). The movie radiates a palpable destructive energy as Nero’s odyssey takes him though chaotic urban streets, scummy flea-bitten hotels and raucous grungy nightclubs. Despite being released in 1995 the movie touches on issues which are disturbingly contemporary, both societal and individual as our apparent search for virtual escape and voyeuristic porn leads to anomie and isolation. Probably the most unsettling part of the whole movie is when Fiennes and Sizemore experience Iris’s murder as perpetrator and victim, and it made me think of Michael Powell’s chilling 1960s film Peeping Tom. This is an exhilarating ride, told with an uncompromising conviction and audacious bravado and definitely deserves its place as a nearly-masterpiece of its genre. Highly recommended.",1

"Not a read-in-one-sitting book A game of thrones is a well written fantasy novel set in a rich medieval world. The song of ice and fire series is one of the most popular fantasy books to date because of its interesting and unlimited amount of lore, and has even been adapted into a critically acclaimed TV series. All of this builds up a lot of hype, and maybe that's why I found it so disappointing. Personally, I consider myself quite an avid reader, and if I have the time, I often read books in one sitting. But I just couldn't do it with a game of thrones. The book itself is quite hefty, at 780 pages (not including the guide to the different family houses) and the way it's written can make it so dull at some points that I considered putting the book down for good. The characters are well developed and likable, but there is just too much description given for even the most minor of characters, and it often seems as though George R.R Martin has deliberately tried to make the story as drawn-out as possible. I f you are a casual reader, I would advise you to treat this book like the plague and stay as far away as possible. If you are a very avid reader I would advise you to try it out, and I hope that you can get swept away by it as so many others have, just please don't become a simple minded over zealous fan, who shouts at you for even the smallest criticism of the series. Maybe it's just not for me...",0

"Dull, overcast with spots of rain. Many years ago I saw Blur touring Parklife in Barcelona and sitting on a balcony right above those queuing for the gig sat a young man watching us and looking miserable as sin. I was going to give him a quick 'Oy, mate, cheer up!' but not knowing who he was (he could have been the Catalan cleaner for all I knew back then) I thought better and left him alone in his blue fug. Yes, you guessed it, Damon Albarn. Well, his latest album sounds just like he looked back then: no fizz, no fun, no frolics. For a man who has fashioned a magnificent career using only the finest and most orignal rhythms, production and chutzpah, this is a drabdrabdrab let down. Even the two most lyrically memorable tracks,  Mr Tembo and Photographs, don't do enough to merit a third star. So, Mr Albarn, take some of your well-earned duckets and cheer the fug up!",0

"Compelling, exciting and bizzare! A Great read Ben Macintyre knows how to tell a story, and the story of Kim Philby and the Cambridge spy ring is totally brought to life. It seems extraordinary now that he was able to survive as a spy for so long, but that was as much about the establishment/old boy network, and he being able to hoodwink them, as it was about Philby's clear skill at leading a double life and masquerading as a social lion who seemed to be able to sweet talk anyone. A great read. Check out his other books to. Thought Agent Zigzag was fantastic!",1

"Religious claptrap obfuscates a beautiful story Reviews of this book need a little balance. I bought this story expecting a story of great courage and the indefatigability of the human spirit. While you do get that, you have to wade through the most obnoxious religious claptrap you're ever likely to read.    I was barely able to make it through the foreword in which we're told that the author's spirit had merged with angels of compassion and that her love of god had dissolved the hatred and that a cross of light had prevented her from being murdered.    It does the story no favours to attempt to imbue it with this superstitious magic. The Rwandan civil war was such an horrific period - around a million people murdered in 100 days - and it happened so recently that I find it shameful that the opportunity to analyse the events and to learn from the author's shocking experience has been ambushed in part by theists for propaganda purposes.    Ilibazia did not survive for 91 days because she prayed or because she loved God (implicit in that childish belief is the idea that none of the murdered million had similar beliefs). I hoped this book would shed more light on how she did survive and, as importantly, how she felt through those 91 days and how she has coped afterwards. The religious conflation obfuscates that important story and does a disservice to the book and the reader.",0

"Good and Bad It is really hard to know what to say about this book. It was a book of many parts. At times it was very slow, especially at the beginning, but it did pick up at other times. I found myself speed reading a few pages as I got bored. There were some humorous moments but also some moments that I felt were poking fun at certain types of people which I didn't find funny and left me feeling rather uncomfortable.<br /><br />Jamie is a lonely farmer looking for a wife. Lydia is a spinster school teacher who lives with her mother and wants a man to take to a friend's wedding. I am sure you can imagine the rest! However there is a little more to the book than just the personal ads in the paper. We have flashbacks to Jamie's childhood in an orphanage which was neglectful and cruel. Also the ending isn't exactly as you would expect from the beginning but I did work it out about half way through the book.<br /><br />I did feel for both Jamie and Lydia in this book. Although Lydia had received more in her life, they were both lonely people deprived of love and attention. Despite this, however, I struggled to relate to Jamie's childhood flashbacks. I am not denying that some of the Irish Catholic orphanages were cruel and viscious places in which to grow up, but I felt very apart from the conditions that were described. I didn't feel  a part of those flashbacks, the writing made me distant in some way so I was unable to empathise.<br /><br />I wonder if the author attempted to deal with too many things in this one book. I don't think she did justice to the subject of the orphanage abuse. I wonder if by touching on it in a book which also included so much humour and poking fun at stereotypical characters, trivialised the whole subject.<br /><br />Whatever the problem was, this was not a book that I entirely enjoyed or felt comfortable with. It was very much a curate's egg, good in parts. I am not sure that I would seek out any future books by this author.",0
"Beautiful, beautiful movie. I'm not usually into tear jerkers, but this one had me hooked, and crying like a little baby all the way through.<br /><br />Absolute must-see. Bullock was a amazing.",1
"AWESOME Such a fantastic book and so quotable. The most memorable (and true) must be, 'Life is not a wish-granting factory'.  I would recommend this read to anyone- incredibly heart-warming and funny. John Green writes with an individual flair which brings the book to life in a candid and beautiful way that any other author writing the exact same storyline wouldn't have been able to compare to. Fab fab fab",1

"I managed to finish the book, but... I don't often write reviews but it's probably only fair to comment on this book, if only to save other people from falling for the hype of the 'Addictive No.1 Best Seller'. I can't quite put my finger on one reason I don't like this book as in fact there are several.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Starting with the characters; I didn't feel an affinity to either Nick or Amy throughout and didn't particularly care that he was stupid enough to take her back at the end of the book. I would say though that Nick is the more human of the two although he has an unbelievable capability of falling into traps that he sets for himself by not being 100% honest or omitting certain truths to the police and that's not even mentioning the spiral of events he gets sucked into by Amy. She's a whole different kettle of fish and there's something almost mechanical about the way in which she acts which does not change throughout the book; despite the big 'twist' when it's revealed that the 'diary Amy' isn't the real her (apart from the 'girl-ier' language in the diary I certainly couldn't differentiate between the supposed two sides to her character). I've yet to read a less likeable character as she has no redeeming qualities, no shred of empathy, devoid of emotion and also seems to be above humanity as well as the law.<br /><br />As for the plot... as others have mentioned before me it's very repetitive as each character gives their own version of certain events and then tells someone else about it and then tells another person the same tale and then goes on tv to tell the whole of America about it (you get the idea). By the time you get to the end you'll have had the same deja vu fifteen to twenty times. There are things which are added in which seem unnecessary and are written for no other reason than to shock; such as the banter in Nick and Go's relationship starting on page 23. And of course because twins in the 70's were a rarity (really?) they have a telepathic bond, are 'the cousins of unicorns and siblings of elves'. I think the twins and mythical creatures ideas may have had less predictability and more promise than the actual book as I knew all along it wasn't Nick who 'murdered' Amy and that she'd planned it herself - it was too easy to guess. I'll also add that the when Amy gets 'kidnapped' by Desi and  then kills him to tie up the loose ends in her story and go back home it just feels like the authors quick fix or get out clause to a story which has gone on long enough and hasn't progressed where she wanted it to by that point.<br /><br />I battled through to the end of this book but perhaps at the end it would have been better written had Amy not had her money stolen and followed the her original plan because the book leaves you thinking that this phychotic woman will soon be bringing up a child with a man who has given himself no other option than to stay with his wife till 'death do us part'.",0
"absolute tosh this is an awful film. you know the way you keep buying resident evil films, hoping that they will be as good as the first one and they are always terrible.

"Self Indulgent Nonsense Against my better judgement, I was carried along by the hype for this book, thinking I might just learn something from it.  I'm afraid I was terribly wrong.  These were the mutterings of a very selfish woman, someone who pretended to be spiritual but doesn't know the real meaning of it.  She took her happiness at whatever cost and so much of what she wrote about just didn't add up.  I was gratified to meet someone from the other side of the world who thought exactly the same as me.  If we all went off to 'search' for ourselves and find what made us happy, what a sad place the world would be.  This was neither satisfying nor inspirational.  I finished it because I thought I might find something but it was a long, hard, boring read.  Beats me how she ever persuaded anyone that she was interesting.  She is very full of her own self importance and I paid money to learn that.",0

"Unfinished Business It's undeniably unique in both it's sound and it's writing and takes a deep, intriguing dive into the colourful realm of modern art-rock, but This Is All Yours too often feels rushed and rather poorly thought out, frequently resulting in a bizarre and disjointed feel.",0

I've been watching 3D movies for nearly 2 years, but these DVDs don't work.  Both DVDs stop and start and stall constantly that I gave up.  Plus, there is an annoying box at the bottom left of the screen that constantly pops up letting you know where in the movie you are.  The DVD description says clearly that it is universal and plays on all 3D DVD players.  I will have to try to return this.",0

"computer generated special effects and riddle like plot which film makers apparently tried to complete with ... This has to be one of the rare times that I agree with Rotten Tomatoes' ratings.

"Novel set in 17th Century Amsterdam The swirling mists ripple along the canals of Amsterdam, the echoes of voices find their way through the chilly air, footsteps clatter over the cobblestones. The city of the 1680s comes alive in the capable hands of author Jessie Burton, a finely crafted story with a motley array of interesting characters. The smell of rot, canal and fish, the cold air spiking everyday life and the slap of water in the canals evoke the echoes of footsteps past.<br /><br />Petronella Oortman arrives at her new marital home on the Herengracht in the Autumn of 1686. On arrival she is greeted by Marin, her husband’s sister and the two servants, Cornelia and Otto. On paper she may be married to Johannes Brandt but he seems to avoid her from the outset. The household’s hostile, suspicious welcome sets the tone for this eerie narrative, as she tries to settle into her new life, the wife of a wealthy merchant who travels the world in search of new merchantable goods.<br /><br />No contact, with no wedding night – it is not the marriage she envisioned. Her husband almost seems to be avoiding her. As if to make amends for his inattentions, he arrives one day with a beautifully crafted doll’s house, a miniature replica of the marital house in which they live. She looks through Smits List and finds the details of a miniaturist of whom she asks just a couple of small items so that she can start to furnish her empty cabinet. And as the items and figures begin to arrive, so do the smoke and mirrors of her life on the Herengracht, played out over just a few months, as the icy grip of Winter plays host to human foibles and machinations with dire consequences. A top novel, enjoy!",1
Five Stars Perfect gift,1
"Not Interesting This DVD has wonderful actors in it, yet it leaves much to be desired.  It's slow moving and the plot is dull.  It needed more romance, perhaps an affair would have helped it.  The dancing was lovely, but it needed to lead to other things which it did not.<br />Basically, it was boring and I was disappointed because I think Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez are both great.",0

"Average - which for MGMT is criminal. To me, MGMT made two of the best albums of the late noughties. I've had a good go at getting into this album, but it simply lacks the quality of songs that characterised their other work. No amount of layered psychedelic production can get over the fact that they took over 3 years to come up with a very average set of tunes that lack the spark and joy of their earlier recordings.",0
"Fairly Good Techno Thriller Prey is set mainly in the Nevada desert. At a research lab, an experiment with limited intelligence, nano technology, has gone wrong. some of the nano particles have escaped into the atmosphere, and are starting to learn, adapt and multiply outside of the laboratory environment. As they become more intelligent, they start to become a threat to the scientists<br />inside their facility.<br /><br />I found this book slow moving at first. We are introduced to themain character, Jack Forman, an unemployed IT expert, and his family. His wife works at the research lab, in the desert, but the first part of the book deals mainly with Jack, and the increasingly strange behaviour of his wife. I suppose this is good from the character building point of view.<br /><br />Once, he visits the research lab, however, the book starts to get going, and the suspense starts to build, as they realise the enormity of the problem that they have on their hands, and the novel becomes a race against time, to destroy the nano particles. Overall, a fairly good read, with a few twists, but, also, very 'technical' in places.",0

"Born To Die When I logged on amazon in order to write my review on this album, I was surprised by the number of people giving it 5 or 4 stars.<br />  This is not a good album, her songs have almost no meaning , the titles of them are quite random (e.g. \\""""Diet Mountain Dew\\""""). She seems to speak more than sing.<br />  Most songs are about nothing, so if you prefer to find meaning in songs, this is not an album for you.<br /> On the bright side - I quite like her song \\""""Video Games\\"""" as it has more depth then the other ones. You will appreciate this album more  if you are running or doing any other sport due to the songs rhythm.<br /> But, better borrow the CD from a friend. Don't buy it, or just buy the desirable song, not the whole album.",0

"A masterpiece of anti-climax I found this book a poorly constructed sequence of ani-climactic events. The only satisfaction it gave me was a strong sense of pride in being to get to the end without throwing it in the rubbish bin. I only achieved this because I thought it HAD to get better. But, no, it got worse and worse with the last 25 or so pages a particular struggle. In the early stages I thought Dan Brown was trying to impart some challenging and very thought provoking ideas but everything cumpled into a boring, muddled morass.",0

"Better get the original versions Carlos Santana is a fine guitar player who can turn an already excellent song into an outstanding song. But he can also turn an outstanding song in a very moderate nothing special, 13 to the dozen type of song. Depending on the version you buy, you'll get 12 or 14 songs that are fine songs by themselves but all received the \\""""Carlos Santana and his all star friends\\"""" treatment and most of those songs did not get any better from that. Nice to listen once or twice but not a regular guest of my CD player.",0
"there's no point reading it if you don't like that style of literature Bought this for school study. It's typical oldy-worldy prose. Basically, there's no point reading it if you don't like that style of literature. Shelley's style is boring and complicated and she takes a very long time to make her point. Her characters aren't very well rounded or believable and the outcome of the story is thoroughly miserable. However, if you're a fan of the Gothic I suppose you would consider this as a &#34;must-read.&#34; In terms of studying, this edition was a good choice for making notes in the margins and highlighting etc. Served its purpose.",0

"Disappointing vokal performance What to do? What to say? Shall you carry our treasures away? And that's exactly what they did. Carried this musical treasure away, three away the key. And hoped noone would notice the mess they left behind.<br /><br />This is the best Music of all time. Yet the worst rendition ever made. The movie itself is astonishing even though Russell Crowe does his absolutely best to mumble it to pieces.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Samantha Barks and several others in the cast can obviously sing. However in the exaggerated artistic freedom Tom Hooper tried to give them, they fall through.<br /><br /> They should have been given the freedom to sing their best in a studio. And then act their best on the set. With this sing live as you act thing, they never really excel vocally. It's flat and mumbling and even on the soundtrack you can hear they're focusing on everything but singing.<br /><br />I have almost every recording made in English of Les Misérables, and this is by far the worst. When the music is so important, they should have focused on making the singing as good as it could possibly get. I'd rather listen to a recording of the 25th anniversary concert than this.<br /><br />And not to start on how the casters of Russell Crowe really should take a good look in the mirror and wash their ears. It's sad that the name is worth compromising the singing. He can't hold a note for more than to seconds, have absolutely no power in his voice. And couldn't win a sing-off with a toad. I've never been so disappointed when reaching Stars is Javert's Suicide (apart from finally being free from listening to someone strangling an old cat).<br /><br />If you're not a hardcore fan or just being introduced to this wonderful musical, stay clear! Use your money on someone who can sing. And someone that actually thought it best to let singers sing their best when releasing an album.",0

"Teaching SPSS, or rather the biography of a SPSS teacher. I guess I will have to be the first one to write a review that goes below 3 stars for this book, over a total of 60 reviews already written.  This review is based on the 3rd edition, the last one (as of 2011).    I start from the basic idea that the reason someone would buy an spss manual is to learn how to use spss. If I wanted to read the funny biography of a (funny?) statistician then I would turn not to a book which has 'discovering statistics using spps' as its title.    Yet the book is crammed with 50% self-pitying, wanna-be humorous remarks about the author's life and the rest 50% consists of, admittedly, good explanation on statistics and spss.    But I don't like to waste my time when I don't want to, and the time I allocate to statistics is already thin, so halving it by reading about the author's math grades when he was in school is not the best.    Dear Andy, I understand writing a book on statistics is not glamorous as writing a biography, but perhaps you should put your effort in what you do best.  Whenever I am anxious at not knowing something on spps, and I turn to the book, I have to go through 3 chapters of a cabaret script before I am delivered the knowledge. I know you constantly remind me in the book I should not get anxious with statistics, but the best way to wash the anxiety away is, I believe, by getting the knowledge.    Since you like to write books that are personal, I will end this review with my personal encouragement to you, Dr Andy: man up, or go into literature.",0

After Peter Gabriel left years before this album, they already had phil collins lined up (well he sung on selling england) and it was obvious that if peter left and phil, he could step in. And he did and they started producing great albums like a trick of the tail, and wind and wuthering, then 15+ years later phil left. Leaving the band with a bloke from a band called stiltskin. And what you end up with is this horiible (heavy band wanabe) album. You can tell all the old members are their then the singing starts, yuk. The band have branded this album a mistake and they dont like talking about it. The only song thats anywhere near old genesis is alien afternoon.

"Modern day Dickensian coming-of-age novel For me, the Goldfinch loses half a star because I was hoping for and had anticipated a happier ending for the main character with more of a feel good factor - this is the only thing that stops me from saying &#34;I love it&#34;. The last chapter did leave a glimmer of hope but at same time had a strong sense of finality which did not provide the resolution I was looking for. I can imagine Boris' life trajectory but I wonder what became of Pippa, Hobie and even Theo in the end. Having said that if the author had obligingly constructed a Hollywood style conclusion, I think the book would have lost some of its gritty realism which is what sets this novel apart.<br /><br />The goldfinch can seem like a long hard slog when you first start reading, and judging by other reviews this seems to have put some people off. I have to admit that I actually started it a year ago but it was quickly relegated to the bottom of my reading pile, after circa 70 pages, where it lay forgotten until recently. On second reading, I started out with a different mind set, namely the notion that praise for this novel must have been well earned. This was sufficient incentive for me to continue through the first couple of hundred pages until the novel began to develop a pace of its own. The journey ebbs and flows; meandering thoughts, musings on the meaning of life, vivid characters (some instantly lovable, some dysfunctional and many in between), changes of fate, reversals of fortune and action centered around the painting.<br /><br />There are two types of award winning bestselling novels, those driven by publicity / hype and literary pieces of art. IMO, The Goldfinch falls into the latter category and deserves its plaudits. It is a compelling read once you get into it.",1

"Dissapointing This album confirms all the fears that I had about Mumford & Sons' musical progression. Having nailed 2 awesome albums, I feared that they would move away from the banjo and double bass approach and go more generic. That is exactly what has happened. The end result is that they have lost a bit of their musical soul. This album is OK but nothing more than that. They have lost that which distinguishes them from all the other 4 piece bands out there. Disappointing!",0

They made music because they wanted too, not cause they wanted to be popular.  <br /> <br />They would of continued to evolve and recreate and do new things, as they had always done if they did'nt have such a big ego, and consider themselves worthy candidates for the biggest band in the world.  <br />But theres a difference between being the biggest and the best, y'know. <br /> <br />I don't mean to moan, but when I listen to a record for the first time, I think I have the right to go \\""""Wow, this is a great album, its sounds different, fresh, new, exciting - in other words it captures your imagination.  <br /> <br />Thats music - thats real music - however real music is not going out to deliberatly be big, because thats the fine line between money and being genuine. Oasis were once the biggest band because they deserved it, they had the biggest tunes - the best albums, but as soon as you stop being big in the eyes of the media you panick - and you do what you think the world wants you to be. (Heathen Chemistry) <br /> <br />Bush (The Science of the Things), Our Lady Peace (Spiritual Machines, Oasis (Standing on the shoulder of giants), Pearl Jam (Riot Act), U2 (Pop), Live (V) are all rock bands that have suffered going through the predictable dirge of churning out commercial like albums because they were'nt initially well recived, and sacrificing their artisic integrity for success and money. Everyone of those bands have gone the other way instead of doing what they were suppossed to do - and thats make music. <br /> <br />If you want some advice talk to Billy Corgan.  <br /> <br />To put it in a nut shell - U2 may be big these days - but so were The Backstreet Boys, and so are My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the disco.",0

"uninspired I love horror films and was expecting good things from this one but it really is very, very bad. The storyline itself is one of the most ludicrous and unbelievable ive ever seen which means it cant be taken with even a modicum of seriousness. The 'demons' themselves are laughable and not remotely frightening. Theres no creepy or 'jump out of your seat' moments either - It TRIES to, but falls flat. likewise the ending is so predictable and cliched.<br /><br />a real dissapointing film then! in fact it must rank as one of the worst horror films of the past 20 years. and dont even get me started about the acting! Patrick wilson is so wooden you can almost hear his joints creak. And the lady who plays the 'medium' well....what more can i say.

"Despair Absolute tripe.  Don't bother unless you're waiting for a plane at 4am or something.  Plot - unbelievable and fiction masquerading as fact.  Character development - non-existant.  Fast-paced and entertaining if you want something cheesy and easy to read.  Otherwise, avoid like a plague of albino monks wanting to kill the descendant of Jesus.  Nuff said.",0

"Doesn't work This app does not appear on my Kindle Fire HD, and since downloading this app this morning, I have had several problems with my device.  It states I have bought the app, and to find it in my library, but there's no sign of it anywhere.  Now I can't get my emails to work, the time on my device is all wrong, and everything is running very, very slowly.  Maybe a coincidence that my device is having issues, but even so - this app will not appear anywhere for me to open it and see if it's any good.  Not a very happy bunny :-(",0

"Awful Watched the film and love it! Thought I would read the book as well. I found the concept highly intriguing it reminded me of child version of 1984, lord of the flies and a h.g well novel something like that.<br />But anyway the book itself is so boring! I'm 18 and a girl, i wouldn't think I would be the target audience , it more for 13 year old and under, but saying that there are much better books for girls and boys of that age than this book. It took me around 5 hours to read it, and I was utterly disappointed, I would not recommend this book to anyone who I actually like. Save your money and time don't buy this unless you enjoyed things like twilight and thus you probably don't have much taste.",0

I'm a nurse so I have to be AT work (not 9-5 but 7-3), and I'm not looking to start a business - but if I was there are helpful stuff in the book.

Four Stars Great book,1
"A Fantastic Ending To An Incredible World! *No Spoilers in this review*<br /><br />Well Rick Riordan has struck again with epic finale to the brilliant Percy Jackson/Heroes Of Olympus series. This book is the final chapter in a thrilling story of the Greek/Roman mythology in the modern era. The book carries on from the previous book 'The House of Hades' following the story of the 7 demigods tasked with the impossible quest of stopping Gaia and the Giants. However, in this final book we also follow 2 others in both Reyna and Nico as the join together to take the Athena Parthenos back to camp Half Blood to stop the impending war between the Romans and the Greeks.<br /><br />The book gives great insight into the past of Reyna and also really digs deep into the emotional roller-coaster and takes the reader along for the ride as you feel the pain, anguish, joy and every other emotion that each Hero feels throughout their quests. The character development that Rick provides in this book is overwhelming considering how much story he has to fit into the final chapter, but he pulls it off masterfully. The comedy that he provided through every one of his books from Percy's stupid thoughts and remarks to the never ending ridiculous comedy that Leo Valdez provides every chapter provides something to laugh about despite the gloomy overlook of the story.<br />This book is hard to write about without invoking spoilers and so all I can say is that this book is another masterpiece and a brilliant send off for a fantastic story. I cannot thank Rick Riordan enough for the journey through a world that was so easy to imagine and feel a part of, the ending will most definitely make most people feel satisfied (you can't please everyone sadly) and the closure is both a feeling of content and sadness for the reader as no-one likes to see great things come to an end.<br /><br />I highly recommend the entire series and this book especially, I can only hope that the new Norse series with the lead character Magnus Chase can rise to thechallenge and be as brilliant as the story of Percy and his friends!",1
"Not nice to see you, Mr Bond... From the moment I first heard Jack White and Alicia Keys' poor excuse for a song I knew there were serious problems with this film.<br /><br />Major continuity errors from the previous film and serious flaws in the script too numerous to detail mean within the first 15 minutes the film has already taken the great work done with Casino Royale and flushed it down the toilet.<br /><br />The words in the credits &#34;Second Unit Director Dan Bradley&#34; might explain what went wrong with the action scenes - in hiring the man who did the action sequences in the second and third Bourne movies the obviously forgot they were making a Bond movie - that kind of jerky,  hand - held camera work does not fit in a Bond film.  Clearly the producers lost their sense of direction.<br /><br />And then there's the Bond girl you just want to slap ( spoiler alert but if I were Bond I would have given her back to the General), and the villain who is about as threatening as my gran (wanting to control Bolivia's water supply is hardly a dastardly plot - whatever happened to trying to start WWIII? ).<br /><br />I'm just glad that  Marc Forster turned down the chance to direct Skyfall,  as another Bond like this clunking mess of a film would have surely killed the series when it should have been at it's zenith!",0
Well worth it Definitely glad i picked this up.  It was such an easy read which was one of the goals of the author.  I reference things mentally in this book practically daily.,1

"Disappointing after The Gathering Storm I'm pretty much in agreement with L. Ferguson on this, although actually I don't think that the Final Empire is a terribly convincing place either.  Although there are descriptions of the depressing landscape and harsh regime that the nobles inflict upon the Skaa, this does not truly seem to influence the way that the central characters live or go about their daily lives.  The premise is certainly intriguing, but poorly realised.    On the plus side, the magic system is certainly interesting, but as of well over half way through the (hefty) book, it just hasn't been used enough to keep up my interest.  There is certainly a lot of filler, and overall I'm really struggling to get to the end of the book.  If only there wasn't such an obsession with producing trilogies!    Unlike some other reviewers I sought out this book after, rather than before, reading The Gathering Storm (WoT book 12) and really enjoying it.  I'm now slightly confused about how much of this was Brandon Sanderson and how much Robert Jordan, and am keeping my fingers crossed that Towers of Midnight is not a disappointment.",0
"Brilliant The Way of Kings is written absolutely superbly, the world Sanderson has created is novel. The characters are also explored in depth, and are each given a suitable amount of pages, not staying with one for too long to forget about the others. I can't wait for the rest of the series to unfold.",1

"Poor Album This album is one hell of a mess.\\""""When you were young\\"""" is one of the better rock songs of the 00s It's well written song with a unique sound. Unfortunately the rust of the album is abysmal. Many of the songs lack hooks and I feel it's too experimental in places and it just never comes together or really works and is a bit of a empty experience.<br /><br />A shocking album. How Rolling stone magazine voted this album most underrated album of the decade is quite beyond me.",0

I wasn't as gripped as I expected to be and the ending didn't work for me.

Five Stars Brilliant!,1
"Great singing, poor production The pairing of Netrebko & Villazon in a romantic comedy should guarantee a sure-fire hit, but as great as the singing is I felt the whole thing was lacking in charm. The production design looks like a retired Disney / Met number that does nothing much for me, neither did Leo Nucci as Belcore (though he was better than D'Arcangelo as Dulcamara who, despite trying his best, looked ill at ease with his role).<br /><br />The surprising element to me was the relative lack of chemistry between the leads given their excellent Traviata and the equally impressive Manon. The singing was superb; it just felt that the understanding of how to approach their characters wasn't quite up to scratch and this fed into the ultimately tepid impression it made on me.<br /><br />Of the more recent(ish) performances on DVD I think it would be hard to better the Alagna / Gheorghiu DVD. Both leads are comfortable in their roles and the comedy and the chemistry shines through, helped magnificently by far less starry supports.",0

Confirms Hendrix's status as the greatest guitarist that ever lived My sister bought me this album in 1970 when I was 12. It was my very first LP I ever owned. Now 45 years later it is still as refreshing and original as it was then. It's still ahead of its time even now. The sound Hendrix gets from his equipment is incredible. Confirms Hendrix's status as the greatest guitarist that ever lived. Astonishing for its time and in my opinion one of the best live concerts recorded yet never recognised as such by the critics. Don't know why.,1
"Present No idea.  My daughter had it on her wish list for Christmas.  Not my scene, but she hasn't expressed any disappointment",0
"Had to put it down The premise of this book is simply fantastic. But the execution left something to be desired. Then again, I don't suppose that if you want to market this stuff to the average Joe, that you're going to want to write in a complicated sytle. I enjoyed the story, to a point. But I found the lenghty asides while the characters were being chased a bit too much. Also, the use of puzzles and anagrams is interesting, but I enjoyed Katzenjammer by J.T.McCrae more and the way he handled them. I'd recommend \\""""Code\\"""" to anyone who likes an easy read with not a lot at the end. I had to put this book down at one point as I didn't think I'd finish it. but i did.",0

"I did not like this movie, at all, in any way There are few problems in this otherwise horrible excuse of a movie.<br /><br />Like, did it bother anyone else that there's no blood in this movie even though it's an seven hours long battlesequence? Because there really should be blood, because as the battle begins, the orc-Voldemort yells to his troops &#34;paint the field with their blood&#34;. And then there's none. It's like if parents tell their kids that &#34;Hey son, you are going to get a bicycle for you birthday&#34; and then when it's his birthday the kid instead gets leukemia.<br /><br />I am willing to bet my entire lifesavings that there was a scene where the actors fought in front of a completely green backround that was forgot there by the efects team. It was probably after the scene where cgi-Legolas glides through the cgi-air in cgi-slowmotion and before the scene where the cgi-eagles flew towards the cgi-ground with the cgi-orcs and the cgi-dwarfs.<br /><br />It's also a huge shame that the only interesting character in this movie dies in the first minutes, and it's a dragon, and the only reason it's even remotely interesting character is because it was voiced by Sherlock.<br /><br />I must admit that even though this movie is a complete failure in every possible way, it was really brave of Peter Jackson and the company to change the main character from Bilbo that annoying comic relief with ugly beard. I did not like this at all, but it was a brave move anyway.",0

"A must read... Cancer - a subject spoken so sensitively about. It's not everyday you get people making jokes or witty remarks about people with cancer; however John Green effortlessly opens up our eyes and our hearts to the minds of those who suffer from cancer; children with cancer. Hazel Lancaster, a girl with terminal cancer meets Augustus Waters, a cancer survivor. Throughout the book, each make witty remarks about having cancer, and jokes about those who have cancer, trying to make the subject light-hearted; on the other hand they also talk about the difficulties of having cancer and the fight to live a normal life.<br />Although this book features main characters with cancer, this book is not 'a cancer book'; it is a love story, with all the twists, difficulties and life stressors thrown in to any ordinary love story.<br />A heart-wrenching story about friendship, love, adventure and loss.",1

Not much to it really Great graohics and water physics but apart from that nothing really.<br />Would have been good to maybe add a race or some online gaming as you seem to just do the same tracks over and over again collecting money and trading purchases that gets boring and repetitive too quickly which is a shame.<br />Maybe having something like buying faster boats or things like a new house character development like you can start to make him rich with all that money lying around.<br />Anyways I had fun with it before it got too samey for me.,0

The plot is unrealistic for a science fiction, you cannot relate any of it to everyday life, the themes which are portrayed are ones of importance. However I can think of many other books which are written with more skill and a more gripping plot. This plot is dull and boring. The main character is uninteresting and as a reader I develop no bond with any of the characters and so could not careless what happens to them. I highly recommend stirring clear of this read, it is not only boring but pretty disturbing when you are not bored to death by the mundane and endless dribble Lowry puts to paper!",0

Enjoyable Experience I ordered this book for my grand-daughter. At first glance when I opened the book I wondered why there was nothing much inside. I realised that it was an interactive book where the animal cages are opened to reveal the animal inside. My grand-daughter has fun when I read it to her and she opens and closes the doors of the cages. She thoroughly enjoys turning the pages to see the next animal in its cage.<br /><br />An enjoyable experience both for my grand-daughter and I.,1

"Best album of theirs so far. Worth buying for the live studio track extra CD, I listen to it more than I do the actual album CD.",1
"Tiresome nonsense Yes, it's a fast paced action thriller but the plot is so contrived and implausible and the characters are nearly all so stereotyped and unlikeable that well before half way through I was getting bored with it.<br /><br />It contains so much of what is worst in American crime / thriller writing.  The central character, Secret Agent Will Robie is depicted as an all American hero who almost single handedly defeats a bizarre terrorist plot.  What a guy!  Sure, he gets some help from a female FBI agent who also seems willing to put her own and other people's lives at risk, so, hey, she's cool too!  They \\""""gun\\"""" engines, do donut turns, run red lights etc and when they face gunfire from well trained and well equipped adversaries they are seemingly protected by a magical shield whilst death and destruction explodearound them.  You get the picture.<br /><br />And despite a bus full of passengers being blown up and numerous other murders being committed it seems that the FBI agent is the only person officially on the case.  Nonsense, of course but it creates the vacuum of reality which allows Baldacci to hype up his hero.<br /><br />No doubt this storyline would make for a half decent action movie but for me it just doesn't work as a book. It is one shallow chapter of contrived action after another and it simply gets tiresome.",0

"Love it This is great, keeps kids entertained and happy.",1
"All gloss - no substance. Sci-Fi can be so much better I so wanted to like this film and have never come out of a cinema so dissapointed. There are some nice ideas and it could have worked if those in charge had spent a little more time on the script and a little less on the cgi. Some of the plot twists are telegraphed from so far away you are just left shaking your head wondering how they thought anyone would be surprised. SPOILER ALERT - I wont re-hash all the flaws others have mentioned but my personal 'favourites' are when, having discovered a severed alien head on the floor of an unchartered planet, the biologist and the archeologist have an attack of the heebie-geebies and announce 'Nothing of interest for me - I'm off', and they both leave the group to head back to the ship. Needless to say they get lost and are killed off by the leech type 'face hugger'. Closely followed by the decision to bring said head back onto the ship with almost no quarantine procedures and then, for reasons I couldn't understand, agree the smartest course of action is to stuff a live screwdriver into it's ear, pass 240 volts thru it when it promptly explodes.<br />Prometheus should and could have been so good but it isn't. The plot is lazy and the characters are weak and unbelievable. There's some great acting talent assembled here but it's wasted - with the notable exception of Fassbenders android David.<br />In fairness the film looks magnificent but it's like saving up for months to go to a really posh restaurant, admire the silver cutlery and crystal, only to find that when the silver dome is lifted off your main course you find a Happy Meal burger on the plate. Now there are times when you're quite satisfied with a Happy Meal - but this isnt one those times.<br />Second Viewing on DVD - it doesn't get any better. Friends invited us over recently. They had bought the dvd and suggested we watch it. I kept a diplomatic silence and did not give anything away. By the end of the film, the wives were bored and chatting about god knows what, my mate was looking perplexed and I was angry again.<br />Sci-fi can be so much better than this. If you want Big Concept and thoughtful sci-fi (ie not space western's!!), take a look at Sunshine, Contact, Solaris (either version - the George Clooney remake is better than Prometheus), Gattaca, Twelve Monkeys, 2001, and going back even further there's Forbidden Planet and a little black and white gem from Britain called The Day the Earth Caught Fire. These films will restore your faith in film makers and show what can be done with a plot and characters.",0

There is just enough space to write a couple of short sentences, which is nice as you have to think about your response. The cover/inside design is delightful and well done. I really adore having this book on my shelf",1
"Visual quality mostly very high.  Far, far, too long. Visually this film is real eye candy.  Productions standards are (mostly) of the highest quality, although things get extremely silly in the barrel-chase in the rapids. Which goes on, and on, and on..  Then it goes on some more, still goes on for another while till you come to the conclusion that for them to be going down falls and rapids for that time, the Mirkwood elves must have had their clubhouse about half a mile altitude above lake level.  The barrels sliding down disastrously steep falls repeatedly and never sinking under their dwarf contents is.... well it just should never have been done that way at all.  I don't recall any Orc involvment at that point?  It's been a while since my last read of it, so could be wrong I suppose.<br /><br />The studio clearly believes that More is ALWAYS Better - Much, Much better.  So all the sequences where action is served up go on - and on, and on.  Get the picture?  (It's on Netlfix now so you don't actually have to &#34;get the picture&#34; for yourself.)<br /><br />Things are pretty much as to be expected. They take major liberties with the book (which as everybody knows should have provided only one decent film instead of three overstretched overblown epics where no chance is lost to make every part do the work of two. Or three?<br /><br />However although I've moaned a good deal (with good reason) the sequence with Calamity Smaug is beautifully conceived - and then (surprise surpise) goes on - and on -  and on.  Far far too long, much too long.  And it's full of added and extremely stupid dwarf-fightback that had no place in The Hobbit book at all. They cobble up top rate high volume blast furnace meltdown of multiple swimming-pool volumes of gold on the premise that Smaug will oblige by standing still waiting to be gilded.  And of course - he does.  Briefly.  After all, we all know he gets his quietus by the ferry-man called Bard - with the last of special arrows his grand-dad saved up for just such a need.  StephenFry pops up as the Boss of Lake Town, but doesn't get much material to work with. Just as well, although he's a brilliant entertainer in his narrow little genre he's a lousy actor.<br /><br />When Jackson made such a good job of the first three LOTR movies, I thoroughly looked forward to the &#34;The Hobbit&#34; productions, but wondered how on earth they would squeeze (stretch?) it out to provide 3 X 2.5hr movies...  The answer to How is outlined above, but the Why never had to be asked - it was Greed, Greed, Greed.  $$$millions by the Smaug-cavernful.<br /><br />And when that's taken as the measure to judge production by, you can take it that the product's quality will be on a slippery slope.<br /><br />There's precious little left of The Hobbit to get another movie from, as there is so little material left perhaps they'll shorten it down to a less ludicrous length?  Maybe about 90 mins would surely suffice.  Must go read it again to see if I've misremembered anything much.",0
"It's not free!!! Looks like it could be a very good app but it chose my location as London instead of Cumbria which is miles away, and as it only allows you one location it is rubbish. You can get multiple locations but you have to pay to upgrade so for me that is false advertising.",0
"Love Christian, want to slap Ana! I hadn't heard anything about this book but became introduced to it when flicking through the Metro newspaper and there was an advert along the lines of \\""""read the book that everyone's talking about.\\""""  I was intrigued and thought I'd come on here later that day to see what it was all about.  So off to Asda I go and there it is on the bookshelf for £3.00.  Had a read of the back cover, thought it might be something I'd like and at that price thought there was nothing to lose...that is until I came onto Amazon later that evening and read some of the less than positive reviews.  One that kept being repeated (excuse the pun) is the fact that the author \\""""repeats\\"""" several phrases over and over again in the book.  More of that later.<br /><br />So anyway, I thought I've bought it now, let's give it a go.<br /><br />As a big fan of the Twilight series (Breaking Dawn lost the plot a bit - how crap a name is Renesmee), I can see the similarities - man with emotional issues, woman who tries to save him - but where Twilight kept me throughout the series, 50 Shades would have me and then Ana would say or think something really stupid and I'd end up rolling my eyes (a big no no in the book by the way).  For example they'd be in the thrall of passion and she'd come out with one of her many \\""""Oh my.\\""""  Really?  You both can't keep your hands off each other and all we get is an \\""""oh my?\\""""  It got to the point where I thought if I see \\""""oh my\\"""" one more time I'm going to scream!!<br /><br />I \\""""got\\"""" Ana more when she was away from Christian, thinking about the situation that she was in.  A typical female who analysed things to deaf, numerous questions running through her head; when she emailed him she was equally as entertaining and I always enjoyed their email conversations but when she was in his company I just felt the need to slap her (and not in the way that Christian likes) and her inner goddess.<br /><br />The writing technique from the author was laughable in places: - Christian: Ithought I should come and remind you how nice it was knowing me.  Ana replies with \\""""holy crap\\"""".  She's just been brought to the brink TWICE by Christian (lucky cow) and he asks her how it was and we get another \\""""oh my.\\""""  I started to think she didn't deserve Christian as the adjectives she used were not worthy of the good time he was giving her.  Lol.<br /><br />Anyway, to summarise, I enjoyed the angst of man meets woman, woman tries to save man with emotional issues but the writing left a lot to be desired.  Will I buy the next books?  At £3.00, probably yes but not the best writing style by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />Ps.  What's up with the random cat comment in the book?  Author lost the plot for a paragraph there.  Lol.",0

"Dreadful version of an excellent game I own Minecraft on a few other consoles: 360, PS3 and PS4, to be precise. They all have their individual flaws, but they are at least playable. Minecraft for Android completely fails in that respect. It is practically unplayable, and I've tried it on three Android devices (Google Nexus 4, HP Slate 7 Hd , and Alcatel OneTouch Pro) and on not one of them was the game playable. It wasn't buggy, or lagging. The controls are just really, really that bad.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, there's no explanation as to how to use anything. Never played the game before in your life? Don't expect a beginner's guide walkthrough! It doesn't exist!<br /><br />I'm only hoping that future versions will make things like the crafting table function in creative mode actually work, as well as introducing somehow-useable controls for tablets and smart phones.

"I found a big-budget movie I can actually tolerate This movie is quite faced-paced and only has a couple of drawn-out-but-highly-predictable scenes. The humor parts are reasonably funny but not really memorable. The action parts... well, there's a few threats to the protagonists but none has enough screen time to be considered the central threat. The characters are somewhat likable and though there's a few cliched character scenes the characters are not overly-cliched to the point of those in most big budget movies.    The best thing about this movie is its compact. It tells its story and that's it. There's no overly-predictable, almost irrelevent subplots with no purpsoe but to stretch the movie. The characters aren't cliched to the point of being boring or intolerable. There's no massively-long-but-near-superfluous showing off of special effects. There's no overly-pretentious overtones. I'm surprised, but I guess I found a big-budget movie that doesn't annoy me.",0

"Original and creative but not for me I'm not sure how to begin describing Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad  to you, but I'll do my best! I'll start by saying that it's an original and imaginative novel which revolves around a large number of different characters, most of whom are involved in the music industry in some way (be it as musicians, producers, record label owners, publicists, or music lovers). The main theme of the book is time and Egan uses her characters to explore what happens to us as we age and how life doesn't always turn out the way we hoped it would.    I don't know exactly how many characters there were in this book, but it felt like hundreds! Two of the most important are Bennie Salazar, a record executive, and his assistant, Sasha. Most of the other characters are somehow connected to either Sasha or Bennie, whether directly or indirectly. We meet new people in almost every chapter and I found I needed to pay attention to every new name as even someone who seemed completely insignificant could reappear later in the book.    Each chapter is written in a distinct style and has its own unique feel. One chapter takes the form of a celebrity interview; another is presented as a PowerPoint slideshow. Some chapters have a first person narrator; others are told in the second or third person; we move from past tense to present tense, from one country to another and backwards and forwards in time. I don't think I've ever seen an author incorporate so many different styles and ideas into one novel - which could be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your personal preferences. If you like books that are adventurous, innovative and different, then you're probably going to love A Visit from the Goon Squad. If not, you might find it all a little bit confusing and overwhelming like I did.    Many of the chapters seemed more like self-contained short stories than part of a novel and although each one is linked to the others in some way, I thought the book felt too disjointed.For me this made the experience of reading it quite uneven - there were some parts that I really enjoyed and some that just didn't interest me at all. The air of experimentation, along with the PowerPoint presentation and the futuristic world portrayed in the final section, made the whole book feel very `modern' and this is maybe another reason why it didn't really work for me. I suppose I just prefer novels which have a more conventional structure, less jumping around in time and place, and a stronger plot.    A Visit from the Goon Squad sounded fascinating and I can see why a lot of people would love it - it's a very unusual book which sparkles with originality and creativity - but it turned out not to be my type of book at all.",0

"Dear God- What On Earth Happened??? The general consensus here is this album is poor in comparison to the previous two and i firmly agree with what people are saying... this album is a spectacular fall from grace for the band....     the problems are:  the total swing towards the sort of dodgy electro-pop that has stalled Robbie's own career since Rudebox,    the complete absence of the sort of soft rock-pop, stadium filling anthems like Rule The World, Patience, Greatest Day    the huge centre stage role Robbie takes on the album and the complete pushing aside of Gary who was central to the last two albums success.    At least , the band cant be criticised for half doing things, they really have just gone for a totally new sound and maybe some new fans will like it but certainly ALOT of existing fans feel duped and foolish for buying this album ...    The Flood is literally the only song i enjoy... it sits firmly in the middle of the old sound of rousing anthemic songs and this new electro pop sound... the light electronic touches on the track are nothing compared to the rest of the album though, they literally have thrown out the rule book and in a way they can be admired for doing a whole new sound... but really they will pay for it in the long run, im sure (and hope) Robbie will only hang around for this album and the boys can return to the drawing board for the next album as a foursome again and maybe return to the sort of adult pop/rock that has made them so successful since their big comeback... but they will have to work hard to win back the fans they are losing now after this album, i certainly wont be rushing out to buy the next album, i'll be curious and listen carefully before i dream of buying the next one    this will sell a truck load for the hype of Robbie's return and the success of past glories (the last two albums) but it is undoubtedly a poor album full of really forgettable songs...      if you are undecided, dont be duped by the hype, huge sales, or think its as good as the lasttwo albums      definetly not something i will be listening to much    :(",0
"A good movie ruined. I came to this movie expecting to be blown away. I was. By the dreadful editing which made the action sequences totally unwatchable. The Matrix set new standards for action movies and what is to be expected of stars - gone are the days of a stuntman jumping in just to open an envelope in case the star gets a paper cut - now they can expect to spend months training to pull off realistic action choreography. Well, only if the editing lets you see that action and doesn't jump around so much you can't follow a single thing. So, I don't know if Bale learned to kick butt or if he used a stand-in, but it doesn't matter as you can't tell what's happening anyway.  <br /> <br />As if that isn't bad enough, they then reveal Batman's back story - some screw loose loon saved by Tibetan Temple, Ninja-style training and philosophy. I don't know the comic genealogy to know how close this is to the origins of Batman, but it just didn't work for me. The temple and philosophy? Maybe. A ninja? Get out of here.  <br /> <br />The Batmobile was cool. Caine and Freeman delivered as they always do, though they didn't have a great deal to work with. The plot had holes. The story was passable. The sets impressive. The action sequences just blurry mush. See it or don't see it, but it's not a movie to cry about if you miss it. <br /> <br />Really, really, REALLY disappointed with this movie. <br />",0

"Share and share alike A modern horror story where the supernatural is replaced by the supranational.<br /><br />Set in the very near future, the main character is not especially likeable and that discomfort for the reader marries with the themes of this novel, which explores the potential power of an internet organisation called The Circle, which is a fictional mash up of Pay Pal, Facebook, Linked In, Instagram, Twitter, Vine and, of course, Google, mixed with a manic human preoccupation with minutiae.<br /><br />A chilling take on where the obsession with knowledge sharing could go and the absurdity of mankind.  For me the introductory scene setting was too long, but the story is good and worth reading through to the action, as momentum builds to a well worked climax.",0

"Wonderful! This looks absolutely gorgeous! It was exactly what I was looking for. I'd seen the other books in this collection such as Dracula or Grimm's fairy tales and fell in love. So, I decided to look to see if there was anything in that collection that I genuinely liked as a book and came across this one. I love Oscar Wilde's style and I'm sure most people looking at this will as well so I won't delve into the book itself. However, I will say it was a nice surprise to find the book also contained many of his plays as I clearly hadn't read the description properly to find that out. The book is stunning, the gold edges perhaps might seem a little tacky to some readers, but for me it was perfect. Great purchase and I'd recommend to anyone who is a fan of Wilde or a lovely looking book.",1

"Fantasy To Fact and Back Again ‘Sapiens’ by Yuval Noah Harari (2014) is subtitled ‘A Brief History of Humankind’ so any reader should realise they’re faced with a challenging book. The language is straightforward, clear and ‘easy-going’ but the concepts / ideas / arguments  it contains certainly are not. I’d question whether about one third of the book really does relate to a HISTORY of Humankind; perhaps much of the book should be entitled an ‘ANALYSIS of Humankind’ and the last few pages become ‘the FANTASY of Humankind’.<br />Harari sees the origin of extensive social organisation in the human ability to handle ‘fiction’ i.e. ‘There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings’ (P. 29). Isn’t that the development of conceptual thought, based on linking discrete objects by extraction of perceived qualities, leading to such developments?<br />Beware of the author’s love of statistics (e.g. pages 178, 247 and 366). Today we have computerised ‘bean-counters’ which MAY have a degree of currency; as regards previous periods it’s guesswork. So on P. 247 in 1500 he states ‘ABOUT 500 million’ as the world population who produced an ESTIMATED $250 billion worth (‘today’s dollars’) and ‘consumed about 13 trillion calories of energy per day’. He starts with a guess and extrapolates into dream world. This operates throughout the book e.g. on P. 367 ‘In decentralised kingdoms of medieval  Europe, about twenty to forty people were murdered  each year for every 100,000 inhabitants’ BUT population estimates vary considerably, with no trustworthy mortality estimates (review studies of the 14th century Black Death for that) and with no proper law enforcement virtually anywhere so you could probably multiply his estimates by 10 in SOME places and SOME years and be just as accurate.<br />History is an INTERPRETATION of past events / experience of humans. Beware that Harari may appear definite when certainty is impossible – e.g. the chronological relationships between Sapiens and Neanderthal  etc. variants. In his descriptions of especially, to use a term he dislikes, ‘Pre-History’ look for the modal verbs (e.g. may, might, could, should, would) and certain adverbs (e.g. perhaps, possibly, maybe) which betray uncertainty; here’s an example: ‘Fishing villages might have appeared on the coasts of Indonesian Islands as early as 45,000 years ago’ (P.48) but can this statement be supported by EVIDENCE?<br />Often Harari produces stimulating insights– e.g. ‘The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation’(P. 38) or ‘Ever since the Cognitive Revolution’, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens’(P.45). He asserts that ‘at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history’ and is PROBALY right. He rightly says about this period (which he labels the ‘Cognitive Revolution’): ‘It is vital to ask questions for which no answers are available, otherwise we might be tempted to dismiss 60.000 of 70.000 years of human history with the excuse that “the people who lived back then did nothing if importance”’ (P. 61). That is THE key argument in the book: Homo Sapiens has proved most effective (for good or ill!) when challenging the unknown and in the process appears as an ‘ecological serial killer’(P.67). Later he extends this to challenge ‘traditional’ history which concentrates on a ‘tiny minority of elites – kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers – who fill the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.’(P. 101) and is probably right too but is there an alternative analysis which offers sensible answers?<br />‘Progress’ is not always clear cut. After c.10,000 BCE) ‘the average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud’(P.79). Why? Harari insists ‘a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes... domesticated Homo Sapiens, rather than vice versa’ (P. 80), claiming that, from skeletal evidence, human physiques suffered from agricultural toil. Foragers could move on but farmers could not: farming punished the individual but fostered the community. But he forgets the chicken and the egg – human population had grown so it needed greater stability ergo agriculture (and much later ergo industry). Sometimes he uses the modern world to help explain its predecessor as with  humans becoming trapped as ‘luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations’(P.87) and such may produce misleading analogies. He may jump to questionable statements – such as the structures at Gobekli Tepe (in Turkey) dated c. 9500 BCE being  built by foragers (PP. 89-91) when the illustrations would suggest the skills of a dedicated work-force ill-suited to a hunter-gatherer community?<br />There’s a lengthy section flitting between HISTORICAL and PHILOSOPHICAL examinations of the ‘human condition’. This starts with comparing Hammurabi’s Code (c. 1800 BCE),with its ‘eye-for-an-eye’ justice in a rigidly differentiated society, and the US Declaration of Human Rights (1776),’ employing the principle of “all men are created equal”’. He criticises both as being merely based on the ‘fertile imagination of Sapiens’(P.109). Does he exaggerate? I might argue that far from liberty only existing in people’s imagination (as he does), it stems from such statements as ‘No man shall be arrested or imprisoned..... except by the lawful judgement of his equals ....”(Magna Carta :Cl. 39 enforced in 1215 and later the basis of Habeas Corpus in 1679) ; in other words, it forms part of that understanding forming the basis of a human society which enjoys a kaleidoscopic existence throughout time and place.<br />By now the reader might have noticed the inclusion of assertive declarations – e.g. the text accompanying Illustration 19 starts with ‘Kushim..... may be the first individual in history whose name is known to us...’ and ends with  ‘The first name in history belongs to an accountant’. In this way Harari covers the introduction of writing and numeracy (c. 3400 BCE onwards) stressing its use in economic and bureaucratic situations. Why? Because he’s obsessed by the ‘objective’, by the ‘biological’ aspect of Homo Sapiens and so other uses of writing - e.g. sacred texts (NB ‘Hieroglyphics’ means ‘Sacred Writing’), stories and poems – are ignored as, being derived from oral delivery, they  ‘would have lived on even had writing never been invented’ (P.127). Really? Would we now know as much about classical mythology or Icelandic sagas if they hadn’t been preserved in manuscript form, and how much is known of such aspects of non-literate cultures (even by the indigenous populations) today? Homo Sapiens bothering to write down such material might suggest they’re more than a biological entity.<br />The author deals with social stratification (mainly through India and the USA)  stating that ‘Unfortunately, complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies and unjust discrimination’ (P.136) – note both ‘Unfortunately’ and ‘unjust’ (or just) involve value judgements, concepts he might consider invalid re’ a biological entity. So cut them out (plus ‘imagined’) and we have ‘complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies and discrimination’ which seems reasonable. Plato in ‘Laws’ wanted to fix citizen numbers to 5040 so all could participate in government. Modern states are far bigger and,just as Harari argues data needs filters to be effective so does power, hence hierarchies and discrimination required for effective functioning – revolutions occurring when such become parasitic or dysfunctional. Throughout these pages Harari slips out of History and into various social sciences (Political Philosophy (or even Ethics), Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology).<br />Harari turns to that aspect of complex human society called ‘culture’ which he says is a ‘network of artificial instincts’. Surely that’s not right. An instinct is an unlearned response inbuilt in an organism and he’s dealing with LEARNED processes – i.e. norms which should be developed through socialisation. When the author discusses contradictions as being ‘an inseparable part of every human culture’ (P.165) I thought he was about to examine Toynbee’s ‘Challenge and Response’ explanation  for the rise and fall of societies, but I was wrong; he was turning to the INDIVIDUALISED problem of cognitive dissonance.<br />The author argues that history has seen a drastic reduction in the number of discrete ‘worlds’ occupied by Sapiens, perhaps overplaying the argument. In 1450 he states ‘90% of humans lived in a single mega-world..... Most of Asia, most of Europe and most of Africa .... were already connected by significant cultural, political and economic ties’.

However, a History should at least mention such slip-ups on the way as the early 16th century inflation deflationary effects of coinage debasement by rulers illustrating how value depended on the actual metallic content of coins in exchange so coins might split legitimately as well as clipped illegally – and the cyclical nature of prosperity by speculation in ‘invisible’ wealth.<br />He describes the impact of imperialism – with its self-justification and cultural effects –very well, including the absorption of subject peoples into the imperial systems of Rome, China and the caliphates. Empires come and empires go in  accordance with the Mandate of Heaven. What he omits is that attitudes to Empire also come and go – e.g. the British Empire in the 19th century was a ‘good thing’( to use Sellar’s term) but in the 20th century became a ‘bad thing’. Then there’ve been ‘trading empires’, such as the  15th century Venetians or 20th century USA (or are they ‘market’ forces), or ‘cultural empires’, such as 18th century French and 20th century Anglo-American or are they ‘belief’ forces . But, to be fair, this is attempting to be a BRIEF History.<br />Harari stresses the role of religion as a binding force in the march of Sapiens towards unity, adding that polytheism proved far more tolerant than monotheism. However, doesn’t evidence suggest that may been because world most religious activity occurred outside the worship of the main pantheon of gods.<br />Unfortunately, here again we slip off the path of History on to that of comparative ideologies/ religions . The author starts with Buddhism before dealing with the ‘new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism’ (P. 228) Quite honestly, the only link I can see for Buddhism with that lot is that all end with ‘ISM’. Harari concludes modern biological studies have not identified a soul (ergo it doesn’t exist, but whoever thought it ever could be located?) and wonders ‘how long can we maintain the wall separating the department of biology from the departments of law and political science.’ (236). And we enter fantasy land where we find ‘there seems to be no insurmountable technical barrier preventing as from producing superhumans’ (P.403) to ‘the real potential of future technologies is to change Homo Sapiens itself, including our emotions and desires (P. 411). I might refer Harari to Genesis 11:3-8 but, from the last few pages I think he’s already been there.<br />Anyway, somehow we recover  History albeit MetaHistory in the form of change, distinguishing between ‘how’ and ‘why’. Harari states that ‘Those who have only a superficial knowledge of a certain period tend to focus only on the possibility that was eventually realised. They offer a just-so story to explain with hindsight why that outcome was inevitable, Those more deeply informed about the period are much more cognisant of the roads not taken’ (P. 238). I quite agree. ‘Sapiens’ is a typical ‘just-so story’ stressing how Homo Sapiens finds its destiny through Science – ultimately, as far as what is left of HISTORICAL thought in the rest of the book is concerned, as fostered by State and Market finding the money to tackle the Ignorance challenging the heir of the  Cognitive Revolution<br />What did I find missing in this magnus opus? Humankind is the SPECIES called ‘Sapiens’, part of the GENUS called ‘Homo’  which is a tiny part of the KINGDOM of ‘Animalia’ but there is no simple chart showing the classification stages (e.g. FAMILY) in-between, just to get a sense of perspective. The author quickly jumps to the ‘Cognitive Revolution’ (c. 70,000-30,000 BCE) where Sapiens acquired the basic mastery of his environment. He stresses the brain but ignores the contrapuntal thumb (so essential for the creation and manipulation of tools) or the complex ‘voice-box’ (required for the subtleties of language he lauds as a key component in that revolution). Then in HISTORY feudalism is ignored, a European-American viewpoint is overplayed , and certain key activities glossed over (e.g. deflationary coin debasement by the State, medieval intellectual transmission and the VARYING status of gender, literacy, age in different cultures. In the final sections (and OUTSIDE genuine historical discussions)  when stressing the unity of the ‘world’ of Homo Sapiens I think he overlooks ‘electronic multiple-communications’ (to coin an expression) whereby whatever states and markets try to determine through mass communications is being undermined by global emails and social media with both positive and negative effects.<br />In the end I reminded myself of one phrase Harari uses on P.61 - ‘no answers are available’ and decided this applied to much of the book –others would disagree. It’s crammed full with interesting details, illustrations, speculations and arguments. It’s easy reading and thought provoking and I’d recommend it. But it misuses statistics, omits lots of relevant material while including pages of IRRELEVANT details and remains caught within its credo that Homo Sapiens is a biological entity. Initially I would have awarded it 5 stars (largely on the breadth and vigour of its treatment) but then I cut the assessment down to 4 stars (due to omissions and irrelevancies) but finally the warnings given above force me to give it only 3 stars.just as Harari argues data needs filters to be effective so does power, hence hierarchies and discrimination required for effective functioning – revolutions occurring when such become parasitic or dysfunctional. Throughout these pages Harari slips out of History and into various social sciences (Political Philosophy (or even Ethics), Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology).<br />Harari turns to that aspect of complex human society called ‘culture’ which he says is a ‘network of artificial instincts’. Surely that’s not right. An instinct is an unlearned response inbuilt in an organism and he’s dealing with LEARNED processes – i.e. norms which should be developed through socialisation.

"Not the actual original film versions! Another post to say that this is NOT the original film trilogy, they are the remastered versions (han shots after greedo etc). Currently there is no all-in-one version (not in the uk or europe) that includes all the original pre-remastered versions. To get those original films you need the seperate 'Limited Edition' versions that each contain 2 DVD's, 1 the remastered version and the other the actual original film release. I'll put the details below to aid those looking for the original films.<br /><br />For Star Wars IV: A New Hope (Limited Edition):<br /><br />ASIN number: B000FMH8UI<br />manufacturer code(on base of spine): 3391901001<br /><br />For Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back (Limited Edition):<br /><br />ASIN number: B000FMH8US<br />manufacturer code(on base of spine): 3392001001<br /><br />For Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (Limited Edition):<br /><br />ASIN number: B000FMRYNE<br />manufacturer code(on base of spine): 3392101001<br /><br />All three of these 2 disk set versions (that you can find on Amazon also) include the original pre-remastered (han shoots first etc) films as well as the remastered versions.<br /><br />I hope that clears things up for fans like myself that were having a hard time working out where the actual original film versions were!",0

What a load of rubbish! What a terrible terrible film! All everyone does is just sing constantly with out even being able to sing along because they sing stupidly out of tune. As for Johnny Depp how creepy can you get!! Worst two hours of my life wasted tbh. I do enjoy a good musical so long as there is some sort of story to follow along with but this film really is just terrible unfortunately.,0

"pleasant reading not as good as I thought it might be - pleasant beach time reading no more.  I am someone who works ( a lot from home but until 11 or so most evenings) , has children and  now grandchildren but I still finds time to have some outside activities, so one of my friends recommended this book to me.    When I had children I changed my type of work  to be able to be with my children more but I could NEVER  rely on my husband to be there as he was out 7.30 am until 10.30pm 5 days a week and Saturdays till mid-afternoon. The person in the book relied TOO MUCH  on her poor husband (as many husband's do regarding their wife) instead of modifying her way of working - specially nowadays with Internet it is so much easier to work from home and still earn a good salary.",0

"Deceptive. Sounds alright the first time but is actually intensely boring... This is a weird album. When I first played it I thought it was very pleasant, lively and creative. I really enjoyed listening to it that first time. On subsequent listens I was left wondering what I had seen in it that first time as this set of songs is in fact crushingly boring and very difficult to sit through. It's such pedestrian jazz and really Clapton has no place in it. The band overwhelms his playing for the most part and the re-worked Clapton originals simply don't re-work. Layla is a real struggle. In truth this is a novelty record and that's why I enjoyed it the first time round. But the novelty quickly wears off and the buyer is left holding a true dud and feeling more than a little suckered. This is music to accompany a ride in an elevator. But you wouldn't want to get stuck in there.",0

Brilliant film Only problem is its suppose to be 3 discs all extras and special stuff and it isnt. You get a couple deleted scenes and thats it. Its basically 3 dvds of the same film so i now own 3 copies effectively. What is the point of this collectors edition. May aswell just buy single disc and be done with it.,0

"and my favorite albums are the post-Waters era I have been a Floyd fan for years, and my favorite albums are the post-Waters era, particularly the 'Division Bell', so when I heard Gilmour is releasing a new and very last album, I just had to buy it. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with the album. I did not expect anything as good as the 'Division Bell' or even 'On an Island', but I certainly expected much more than what it is now.<br /><br />As been discussed before, the album is mostly instrumental, and there is only one track with singing.<br />When I heard that the album will be mainly instrumental, I was quite happy by that fact. I truly thought that Gilmour decided to spoil us loyal fans with plenty of chill-out guitar solos that will blow our mind along with some brilliant melody created by Wright's keyboard. I'm afraid I was too naive to expect that. The guitar solos are very short, and at times seem like have no relations or connections to the track, whatsoever. One song sounded like the beginning of 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond', but it was so anemic that you're constantly waiting for something to happen, just to find out 2 mins later that the track is over and was merely an intro to the following track. In fact the whole album sounds like an intro to the next track...<br /><br />There was a lot of mess and parts seemed as though the band lost their line of thought, and it does sound, as people already mentioned, like pieces and leftovers of whatever didn't make it onto the 'Division Bell'.<br /><br />It's not the worst album I have ever listened to in my life, as there is so much rubbish out there, but it is indeed the worst of Floyd. And that's the real shame, this is not the way to say good-bye.",0

Can't judge yet! Not sure about the product as it didn't arrive in time for Xmas and we've not got it yet! Very disappointing as it was ordered on the 15 th which I thought would be enough time for a CD to arrive.

"8yr old daughter loved it. I would have rated this lower, except that my 8 year old daughter loved it, and as she is probably more the target audience than myself I have to give it some credit. The idea behind the book had potential, but the execution was lacking. It felt similar to a Rainbow Fairies book, where the main characters find themselves in another world and have to find a list of items, which fall fortuitously into their laps. It's not a book I would choose for my daughter to read, with bad grammar and poor writing in places.<br /><br />Given that the book seems to be aimed at a young audience, there are several terms and sentences used that seemed pretty inappropriate. Luckily they would probably have gone straight over my daughter's head, in which case, why use them? For instance, an experience that the main character found 'trippy', another character was referred to as having had lots of affairs, and at one point, the boy says 'It's so cold, I think we may be twin sisters now'. Also use of the words 'harlot', 'bimbo' and 'floozy'.<br /><br />One other little peeve, that I hadn't really paid attention to until somebody else mentioned it in a review, are the very American and modern sounding names of the four Prince Charmings (I guess he was looking for names that began with 'ch'). I just couldn't take them seriously after that!",0
"Better than the last Wolverine film... ......but that's hardly saying much.  Following on from the 3rd X film, Logan is feeling sorry for himself and plagued by visions of Jean Grey.  This conveniently leads into the story of the film - Logan's immortality (despite the fact he isn't immortal).  Ah you expect any film based upon a comic to have a pretty flimsy plot but \\""""The Wolverine\\"""" is going to take some beating.<br /><br />Wolverine survives the bombing of Nagasaki and in doing so saves the life of a man who in the present day wishes to thank Logan and return the favour.  Its here that the details become thin on the ground, very thin.  The man promises to give Logan what he wants - death.  How he plans to do so is, well never explained in any way shape or form.  He has built up a fortune and a mega corporation but no details are forthcoming as to how.  But it quickly becomes apparent that it doesn't matter.  The film takes off and uses the lazy option - Yakura, family fueds and a completely forgettable mastermind behind the whole thing.<br /><br />So cue the action and lots of running about not to mention plenty of completely pointless scenes (such as wolverine chopping the tree that is blocking the road).  Its all just a time killer/filler until we reach the conclusion.<br /><br />Remember I said the film is thin on detail.  Well it up's the ante and the last 30 mins really drive the final nails into the coffin.  The role of Viper is horrible, instantly forgettable (unless you happen to be writing a review to warn others).  What are her plans, background and powers are virtually unknown.  Sure she is a walking, talking sack of poison but now also seems to have a healing factor which would rival Logan.  The Silver Samurai, well less said the better about that one.  There are plenty of questions regarding the final battle which completely go against everything you know of Logan, especially his powers etc but again details and continuity are chucked out the window.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Wolverine's adventures in Japan based on the comics (which again are virtually ignored bar an opening scene.  Nothing of Logan trying to calm the inner beast) and this is a step up from the last offering but not by much.  Again a missed opportunity to do something.....well interesting.  The final third is not only predictable but also handled in a shoddy fashion and leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  Fine to watch if you like the franchise etc but rather drab for everyone else.  And we never did find out about the 3 guys in the jeep either!",0

"A completely frustrating end. Having heard this was a bestseller to be turned into a movie and with a cover full of raving reviews, I thought I must read it.  However, I can honestly say I was a little disappointed.  The good points:-  - the character's were well developed and atypical to your normal stars of a romantic novel.  - the layout of the book and the return to the same day year after year was originally and you could really see the development of the characters over time.  - from the first page you think you've got the story pegged, but it doesn't follow the stereotypical storyline one expects.  - it's refreshing to read a romance book from a male author  - you want to read until the end as it doesn't fill in all details until the end.  - I do think this will make women think 'I am or I have been Emma Morley and I know a Dexter'.  The bad points:-  - I developed little sympathy for either of the characters in this.  I thought Dexter who was clearly meant to be portrayed as the popular sort who won over hearts and has a mass of charisma, failed to win over my heart.  Instead I thought he was a self-obsessed man with little love for anyone but himself.  He genuinely didn't deserve the quiet and reserved Emma.  In addition to that you felt a little anger for Emma for being trodden over so much and putting up with it.  You usually expect to want a romance to happen between the lead characters, but I wanted little more than for Emma to get her own back on him.  - some of the directions the plot took were just irrelevant and didn't seem to quite fit, particularly during the time Emma spent as a teacher.  - the shock ending angered me and I desperately wanted it to end the opposite way(!).  It also seemed to pay little attention to the shock ending and glossed over it in my opinion.  To conclude, it really wasn't my cup of tea but if there is one thing that this book does - it gets you engaging a whole different array of emotions you wouldn't expect from a romance novel.  It is by no means atypical chick-lit book.",0

When I click back from a video it will take me to the FIRST page I visited, making me use the search box for the millionth time and it changes its interface so often I can't tell if I'm on a Kindle or an iPad.

good not great I loved parachutes and a rush of blood to the head but x&amp;y sells coldplay short.It starts well with square one and what if but white shadows isn't good.Fix you is the best song on the album with martin at his brillant best.Talk is good but I felt they didn't hit the guitar solo at full rip.I bet it would sound amazing live though.X&amp;Y is nothing more than a bad song.The lyrics don't suite it.Speed of sound is useless compared to clocks but for this album its ok.A message is like green eyes but better.Low is one of the best songs on the album with a rocking guitar solo.Likewise the hardest part.I hope it does well as a single.Swallowed in the sea is different and it suites Martins voice.Twisted logic is great.The bonus song is nice and simple.Overall I hope for better next time.,0

Intresting companion to the Aliens Movie This is a really good detailed book.<br />It covers the weapons and equipment used by the colonial marines in the Aliens universe.<br />The illustrations are really detailed and give a lot of information.<br />I am really pleased with it and would recommend it to fans of the Aliens franchise.,1
"The Loudness war hit Sade too I've only heard 2½ songs, then I've started to get a headache. Overblown bass, no dynamic ragne. The sound recording sucks big time! If you're own a good hi-fi setup, and are in to good sound, then avoid this extremely bad recording! I couldn't even stand listening to it on my head amp and Grado RS 1. which is my normal rescue procedure for bad recordings, I've only got a few bad recordings in my CD collection, but non of them is even remotely as bad as \\""""Soldier of love\\"""". The music might be good, but I've never know, because my copy goes to the trash. I've continue to enjoy my other Sade CD's, because there are great i both sound and music.",0

"Disappointing Waiting months for this book and could hardly wait when it arrived.<br />General feeling with this book is its all a bit repetative, they must say how much they cant live without each other about 3 times per chapter, and although not a bad read compared to the 2 previous books (which i loved) it was a let down. I think Gideons character doesnt seem as strong and powerful in this book. I also think that the ending was odd, it was neither here nor there. will read the next book but only because I need to see what happens, lets just hope this one doesnt take another 6 months.",0

"Boring and Shallow I can't quite work if this book is below par compared to the other Shopaholic books or if I have simply outgrown the series. I haven't read any of them in a whilst and was pleased when I got this as I have always enjoyed the series. Maybe I've never noticed this before but I am beginning to find Becky unbearable- she is spoilt, doesn't think and is selfish. I also find it harder and harder to laugh when the book portrays someone who doesn't just love shopping but is actually addicted to it. This book wouldn't be funny if Becky was talking about drugs or alcohol and I don't see why shopping is any better (she gets herself into debt and it threatens her relationships with friends/family).   Her relationship with Luke is bizarre- where is the actual love in that relationship? All they do is keep secrets from one another, there is literally no trust in that relationship but a lot of lies. Still not sure why thats funny.   I find the book unbelievably shallow- Becky lives the most priveleged life- a potential house in Maida Vale, countless designer clothes, looking at private schools for Minnie and yet its meant to be funny she always wants more. And of course in true Shopaholic style Becky gets herself into a fix but it always magically gets sorted. Well actually I'd really like her to get her comeuppance.  As for the book itself the big problem is she wants to throw a surprise party. Right. I can really relate to that. What a terrible heart-wrenching problem.....  As for the book being called 'Mini Shopaholic', the daughter is not that important and is actually quite a dreary, spoilt character who Becky never seems to have to look after herself.   In true Shopaholic style Becky never has to face the fact she can't afford something (as someone else pays) and her fabulous life continues.  This might be escapism for some but I find this book shallow and dreary- I can't relate to her at all. As for the plot- thin at best.",0

"Go past the flashy surface So, I watched this in the cinema in 3D with everyone else in the world. First off, the 3D special effects are AMAZING, no denying that at all. The look is spectacular, it really cannon be beaten. HOWEVER, after the first 20 minutes, the full on effect of the vision started to ware away until I got so used to it, it was hardly noticeable. Thats what would happen in most 3D films. However that is the reason for my lower rating. Once the effects have worn off, you are left purley to see this as a normal film, with story and characters which is wear the film is let down. I ask people this; if this film was done in live action with no special effects, what would people think? If your answer is the same as mine, you will say that it would be purley average! which is why I have given this film a purley average review! It's Ok but certainly not the whole package.",0

"Same I've read several of Keyes' books, the first being Anybody Out There. I loved that book and craved more of her humour, so I went out and bought a handful of her books. I was not impressed! They start of great, with humourous characters and potentialy brilliant plots, but after having read three or four you begin to see her lack of imagination. I have read at least three of her books which are based around the same family. Five sisters, the youngest Helen, next Anna, so on and so on. Her pace of writing is unsettling and confusing, and she can easily loose you mid-sentance.   She has such potential, and if you have never read a Keyes before then you should.. just don't read more than three.I would recomend Anybody Out There, The Other Side Of The Story and Watermelon.",0

"Five Stars fantastic, true matal music, very energetic and real.",1
Good but annoying at same time. This book has heaps of useful tips that can be used straight away to improve your shots and also everything is written in a nice easy way to understand.    However    This book could be reduced by 40% for many reasons - theres to much humour and silly jokes litering the book getting in the way of the useful info.    Theres to much repeated information and some off the tips are so obvious they dont need a whole page explaining. Example - he spends a page explaining that an advantage of digital cameras is that you can experiment and not worry about taking hundreds of shots and not waste any money. Come on my 5 year old knows that.    Also ive read the two other books and have found that the info in this book is repeated in later additions.    I would recommend this book but its not without its many flaws.,0
"Experimental yet succesful series Peter Capaldi. An interesting and controversial choice. Perhaps it was time for an older man after the two pretty boys. I wasn't sure at first but I can now confidently say he was the right choice.<br /><br />DEEP BREATH (9/10): Very action packed series opener. Great introduction to Capaldi's Doctor. Jenna-Louise Coleman performed incredibly here, The Paternoster Gang added humour and secretly bringing back the Clockwork Robots. Genius!<br />INTO THE DALEK (7/10): I had been looking forward to this episode, to meeting Danny Pink. Turns out he's going to be a love interest instead of a companion. *Groan*. But the episode on the whole was good. Nice idea, good actors all round. Some dalek action. Good stuff.<br />ROBOT OF SHERWOOD (8/10): I enjoyed this episode as I have always loved Robin Hood. I enjoyed the old BBC series back when it was on. Although the monsters could have been a bit more imaginative, the way the competition between The Doctor and Robin was played made the episode.<br />LISTEN (9/10): &#34;What if you're never really alone?&#34; Oooo! This one got me! Had the hairs of adults and kids alike standing on end at the back of their necks. It was a nice little scare. And the idea that it was all in The Doctor's head since Clara touched him on Gallifrey was a cool twist. But by now I was starting to worry about the love stuff. Taking up a bit too much of the episode.<br />TIME HEIST (10/10): I just loved this one. It was so slick, so well written. The two actors playing Psi and Zaibra will go far in acting, very good performances. Keeley Hawes also played the perfect villain. And the Teller monster, give the guy who designed that a medal!<br />THE CARETAKER (3/10): NO! NO! NO! We do not want Waterloo Road! Goodness me, too much love-stuff, too much of that ghastly Courtney girl. NOT GOOD!<br />KILL THE MOON (4/10): Oh dear! They brought Courtney. Awful actress! And plot holes, why would Clara be nice to a girl that bullied her when she started teaching.They should have ejected her into space, little brat. The idea was okay if a bit childish and the spiders would have been good if used a bit more.<br />MUMMY ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (9/10): And Doctor Who Series 8 is back on track! The design of the Mummy was brilliant and the whole story even better. That clock counting down at the bottom of the screen every time someone saw the Mummy really added to the terror. The guests of Frank Skinner and Foxes added to the quality of the episode also.<br />FLATLINE (9/10): Doctor in my pocket! Almost comical, this one. I love that The Doctor was stuck in the TARDIS in Clara's bag while she went around solving the mystery like Sarah Jane Smith. The highlight of the episode for me was Jovian Wade as Rigsy. Outstanding performance. He really stole the show.<br />IN THE FOREST OF THE NIGHT (7/10): Trees saving Planet Earth? Well it's original, I'll give it that! The episode would have been better without all those kids, I must confess. Not many acting skills and they all looked a bit clueless on screen.<br />DARK WATER (10/10): Incredible! Capaldi and Coleman at their very best! The Nethersphere and 3W theory was such a good idea. And Michelle Gomez was a perfect M_____, I won't spoil it for you!<br />DEATH IN HEAVEN (7/10) Such a good build-up to the introduction of the Cybermen. Such a disappointment here. Tip for you Steven Moffat; if you're going to do a cybermen episode, be sure to include the Cybermen! Having The M_____ in this meant that there was not enough Cyber action. Think back to the classic days of &#34;The Tomb Of The Cybermen&#34; and &#34;The Invasion&#34;. That's how you do a Cybermen story! It was a mistake in my opinion to kill off Osgood, she was a popular character. And when Santa Clause appeared at the end, my reaction was - &#34;After this series, why not?&#34;<br /><br />ACTORS: Capaldi - really good actor, portrays a darker Doctor really well. In Time Heist, I really accepted him as The Doctor. He may notbe able to run very fast but who cares.<br />Coleman - Clara is one of my favourite Doctor Who companions ever. Coleman is such a great actress and I will miss her when she goes.<br /><br />STORY-ARCS: Promised Land - one of the best arcs yet, that's all I have to say.<br />Danny Pink - yuck! Too much lovey-dovey mush! Why couldn't they have portrayed Clara and Danny as friends. A relationship like that of Jamie and Victoria or Ben and Polly. I didn't see much point of this character seeing as he stepped inside the TARDIS like twice was it? and never actually travelled anywhere.<br /><br />But overall, an experimental but successful series of Doctor Who. Roll on 2015!",1
Disappointed I ordered this DVD for my Mom and was really looking forward to watching it. We were both really disappointed with the film. Being a great fan of Jane Eyre I felt that the actress who played her was insipid and didn't portray Jane in the correct way,0

"A Mixed-Bag Godzilla is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is the second attempt at a Hollywood reboot of the Godzilla film franchise, following the disastrous attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998. The film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston, alongside Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn.<br /><br />Mostly identifiable from his successful low budget film ‘Monsters’, Edwards attempts to take some of the concentrated interior conflicts from the characters in this previous film, and apply them to this film, set to the backdrop of the destruction of America at the hands of the King of the Monsters. Whilst an initial lengthy and thorough exploration into the characters themselves does provide the basis for the following chaos and destruction to have some substance behind it, it results in an opening act which feels sluggish. Additionally, whether it is through his roaring screech or enormous shadow, Godzilla is consistently teased to the audience in an attempt to increase anticipation for his first appearance. The persistent and over-implementation of this technique however simply builds frustration rather than excitement.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Godzilla’s initial appearance is undoubtedly powerful. Never has his vast scaly body looked so beautiful, and never has his ear-piercing roar sounded so authentic and frightening. The CGI as a matter of fact is almost faultlessly immersive throughout the entirety of the film, as is the sound design and hypnotic soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. Greatly to the director’s credit, the film from this point does manage to maintain a feeling of panic and horror, and does manage to hit many of the emotional beats that felt lacking during the film’s first half.<br /><br />Fascinatingly, this is both the film’s greatest asset yet also its biggest hindrance. The film excels so marvelously in its final acts that it leaves its opening feeling dry and even somewhat mechanical. All things considered, the film is clearly a mixed-bag, but a worthwhile watch nonetheless.ling dry and even somewhat mechanical.

The Paleo Diet Book Best Diet I have ever Been On. Works Wonders. And I Highly Recommend this Book If you Really Want to Get Healthy.,1
"Good fun One of the latest new trends in Hollywood is to take age old fairy tales and turn them into big blustering blockbusters. So far the results have been a little lacklustre. Alice in Wonderland was a hollow, boring example of lazy filmaking and the recent Hanzel and Gretel also hasnt done much to pursuade the general public that all of this is a good idea.<br /><br />So it is with some pleasure and a little surprise that Jack The Giant Slayer is actually good! Okay, so not a classic by any means and if you want a little brain with your brawn you are definately in the wrong place, but for a bit of fun for a couple of hours you could do a lot worse.<br /><br />We all know the story of Jack and The Beanstalk so there is no point re-treading old ground. This version takes things a step further by adding a whole array of giants and getting them into a war with the human world.<br /><br />When Jack's house is lifted into the sky by the fast growing weed taking the kingdom's princess with it, he springs into action. Or, more accurately, climbs into action. He and a bunch of hapless knights head into the clouds to find themselves at the mercy of the giants.<br /><br />The giants have been waiting a long time for their chance to enter the human world again, so they waste no time in waging war.<br /><br />The giants themselves are rendered well and given some nice personality traits. If anything it would have been good to spend a little more time with them on their turf, but this film is not about to waste time on bulding character and worlds.<br /><br />Generally the action is good but a bit more would have been welcome. The final battle starts off great and watching the giants tear apart an army and lay siege on the castle is great fun, but it ends rather suddenly. Just as it feels like it is going to get even bigger it stops, almost as if the money dried up!<br /><br />Nicholas Hoult and Ewan McGregor are good for the money and seem to be having fun with this. However this isfirmly all about the giants and they steal the show. Whilst the film is fun it just felt like there could have been more of everything. If ever a film was screaming for some sort of sequel this woud be it. It would be good to venture back into the giants domain and explore their world a litle further.<br /><br />For a bit of light fun, this really does the job.",0
Gripping and fun This game was really good. It was easy to play and some of the puzzles were quite challenging. Graphically this looked lavish and movement between locations was kept to a minimum .

"Don't feel too bad if you `overlook' this sorry effort! As you can guess from the title I'm going to echo much of what has already been said in most of the other reviews on here. What I will say first of all is that I wouldn't waste money on this Connelly novel, unless it's going really cheap at some book shop, or jumble sale that is.  Mainly because it is no real asset to the series so far, or future books, so it doesn't matter if you skip this one, which I recommend, you do.  I can't rave on and on about how this book is bad because when you read, it doesn't feel like a bad book. Yet it is so terribly short and abrupt that you just marvel at why Connelly even bothered to write it. It's not even like the plot is a particularly good idea, more like a throw away script from the TV series 24. The story takes place across twelve hours and involves a terrorist plot, so you can kind of see where I'm coming from.     I mean it's always nice to read about Bosch, don't get me wrong, he's a great character. It's even nice t see him with Rachel again, although there relationship grows no further and after a while her presence seems unnecessary and there just to make things a little more personal for Bosch. As always the story comes together nicely and it all works out with some nice twists that are not entirely unpredictable, but this book will just leave you dissatisfied and baffled at why this book came into print. It's not like Connelly to let fans down this much, but this time the book has nothing to save itself from being... well... quite frankly pointless. Bizarrely the book contains an interview with Harry Bosch in the back, which all feels rather weird, where Connelly actually interviews his fictional character. Fair enough, but even this feels like an attempt to pad out pages to get it on to shelves. What with that and the first two chapters from the Brass Verdict, the book is even thinner than first assumed.     Okay the bottom line is the story is not entirely unreadable and the narrative is always nice and easy to readwith the odd poetic note from the usually masterful Connelly. However the book does not have enough content, the plot is very different from what fans are used to - and the whole thing ends too rapidly, leaving you cold, let down and baffled. Even if you are a fan and are yet to come across this one, please don't bother. Don't feel bad, it won't affect future books and you can save yourself the time and the empty feeling of being let down by a usually trustworthy author. I don't know what Connelly was thinking when he wrote this, or why he felt it was good enough, especially after the brilliant Echo Park, but I'm sure this was a one off dud book and that he will no doubt return to form and continue to impress us in future.",0
"Violent Violence of the sort found in most every action flick you ever saw, a mix of martial arts and streetfighting with very out of time weaponry (gatling in a mediaeval European forest?) The language is adult stuff with witches and their hunters using F words and so on, which along with the very American dialogue throws it right out of kilter.<br /><br />The whole idea of revisiting the H&G fairy tale - which originally was an extremely nasty story, with cannibalism and murder at its core - was a decent one, but I feel they failed to hit anything like the right balance with their treatment of dialogue and the usual US Kick Ass attitude where more arrogance and bigger guns will see you through any tight spot. Some of the weaponry is comically nonsensical, why would anyone use a crossbow (even a semi automatic one) when firearms are apparently available?<br /><br />Famke Janssen must have had fun playing the uber-witch (called \\""""Muriel\\"""" - why?) and we even get a Troll tossed in for no extra - even though Hansel has a reasonable one liner when he tells the townspeople that Trolls Are Extra... which was a nice smiley moment.<br /><br />The violence is far too ordinary, being mostly physical punch-ups, why would witches get involved with such stuff - why be a witch if you insist on punching and stabbing as your mainstay battle tactics?<br /><br />Probably because it's cheaper than the inevitable CG that's needed to produce satisfactory magic effects?  Maybe the budget got blown on all those mediaeval village sets, which were well done, it should be said.<br /><br />This is probably an adult film, given there's a teensy spot of white-witch nudity and lots of adult swearing, which seems odd when the title isn't one I'd have associated with trying to pull in adult audiences. A strange mishmash overall, fine for a Halloween evening view?",0
"Fantastic! I bought this film on Blu-ray as I had seen some very good reviews by online movie reviewers. Right from the opening sequence I could tell this was going to be a good film.<br /><br />One of my most favourite things about this movie would have to be its soundtrack. The music in it is just superb. It's a shame movies nowadays don't have such amazing soundtracks.<br /><br />It was also a wise choice purchasing this on Blu-ray, while most scenes were excellent quality but nothing special, there were certain scenes that had incredible detail. Such as the faces of 'Gaff' and 'J.F. Sebastian', you could see every little scar and crevice in their faces.<br /><br />Also, as it turns out, this film is one of the options to study for my Leaving Certificate final exams! Score! :D<br /><br />I completely recommend this film. All the hype and excellent reviews are well deserved. *****",1

"Pompous and patronising \\""""I've no desire to preach from authority\\"""" says Mr Goldacre at the end of this book, having done nothing but for 320 pages.     This book is important, and it's hard to argue with Ben Goldacre's points. But it's even harder to warm to his style. He treats his readers like morons and is so self-satisfied and superior it's hard to stomach even when you're wholeheartedly on his side.     He's constantly telling you what you will or should find easy or difficult to understand. He's unable to repress his loathing and contempt for people with humanities degrees, using journalists' humanities backgrounds as the main explanation for their mendacity, laziness and stupidity. His style makes him seem almost happy that there is so much ignorance and misrepresentation in the media, and so much malpractice in the healthcare industry, simply because these things make him look noble, wise and heroic by comparison.     He closes with a section directed at 'academics and scientists of all shades', who he advises to start putting their knowledge on blogs to counter the misinformation. \\""""You will do it because you know that knowledge is beautiful, and because if only a hundred people share your passion, that is enough\\"""".     Is it, Mr Goldacre? I suppose I agree, but isn't that's for me to decide?

Great book! I love this book so much! It is very fast paced yet easy to follow. I'm 14 yet still I would've enjoyed it when I was a child and I still enjoy it now. I love it!

"Oh My God!!! This is actually the first Stephen King book i've ever read, but i've seen all the movies made from his books and thought they were absolutely brilliant.  so many of my friends have tried to get me to read his books, so seeing this, his new one in the book shop, i thought i'd give him a go.  I cannot describe how disappointing i found it, i only got to page 187 and gave up, he seems to need four pages to describe one little thing, and was talking about 'bools and bad gunky' i honestly had no idea what this book was supposed to be about.  save your money on this one cos you'll only be disappointed too.",0

"they gave her no choice, but you still have one. i was looking forward to seeing this movie. a female mma star as the lead in an action movie was a bold move and one i hoped would pay off. it didn't. the plot was predictable and a rehashed version of many other films in the genre. the action was boring and uniteresting, whilst the acting was stiff and dull. many reviews talk about a plot twist. what plot twist? it was all so obvious and mundane. truly disappointing and not worth your time.",0
"Could be better This adaptation of the book is good, however it does deviate from the plot a lot in my opinion. For example the entire period from the break down of the wedding to the end of the book is encompassed in only 1 hour and should have had more time spent on it. Important details are also left out of that final episode, for example Jane searching the village for somewhere to live and eat before stumbling across the Rivers household where she is rejected and then taken in. Additionally the beginning of the program with Jane as an infant living with her Aunt before she goes to school is about 2 minutes long when in reality it should be longer.    All in all, however it does make the plot of the story clear and is enjoyable.",0
its ok Its good when your bord,1
Two Stars OK but pretty childish really not for adults,0
bubble witch saga Great fun but some levels are very frustrating game keeps giving hints such as putting webs over the end pots but does not tell you where to get them,0
"Mik-a Better Album For Everyones Sake!!! With all the hype surrounding this album I could not be more disappointed. 'Grace Kelly' is great... but the rest of the album is awful. OK, so he does sound like Freddie in 'Grace Kelly' but not in any of the other songs, more like a teenagers attempt at karoke.  <br /> <br />I couldn't believe he could also ruin the song 'Dying in Your Arms Tonight' with 'Relax (Take it Easy)'. I am a huge fan of this music genre but I will not listen to this album again in a hurry or at all.  <br /> <br />I am disappointed that people can relate this album to the scissor sisters or Queen. It is more than an insult to compare Mika with these hugely talented musicians. I realise I might be alone on this one... But once the hype is over people will understand my views.",0
"WINTER IS COMING I'll admit it, I was a bit apprehensive about watching this show at first. I'd heard how, ahem, graphic it was, and was debating whether to give it a go or not. Thank God I did.<br /> I was completely hooked after Season One. The storyline, acting, costumes, effects etc. are all amazing. HBO have really done themselves proud. I am very pleased to see that they have maintained the same standard for Season Two,<br />Without revealing too much, the Battle of Blackwater Bay was just spectacular! It was so good I'm sure it'd rival Lord of The Rings in terms of epicness. I really cannot stop thinking about Thrones after watching this season!<br />I encourage EVERYONE to buy it. Thrones is one of the greatest television programs in existence!",1
DON'T BUY THIS APP This s a piece of crap.<br />It doesn't work on the Kindle Fire Hd nor does the normal.<br />the maker's were dumb enough NOT to include camera's<br />if I could give it no stars I would.,0

"DVDs do not play GRRR This is not a comment on the quality of Glee, I am a fan and enjoy the show which is why it is so frustrating that this is the second box set of season 4 that has been purchased through Amazon that does not work! The first disc plays fine and then every episode after skips.  For this to happen once was bad enough, you can put that down to a dud but for the exact thing to happen again is just disappointing. I will not be buying a third set ...",0
Beautiful Music Beautifully packaged - but let down because the cardboard sleeves more or less disintegrate as one opens each - and plenty of them.JE Gardiner as always excels.,0
Another disappointed voice. I would like voice my disappointment along with almost every other reviewer for this version of World at War.     Cropping the original picture to fool those of us who do not understand what true widescreen is into thinking that's what we have been given is wrong. It is not appropriate to remove vast sections of a frame when attempting to remain as faithful to the original image as possible. Remaining true to the original image is of crucial importance when context is of such sensitive historical significance.    A primary aim should be to convey the visual truth of the events and horrors that people experienced in the second world war. I will not be buying a copy of this version documentary due to Freemantle's disregard for this.,0

"Good identification of problem/ lack of solutions The book starts off really well, where he identifies the enemy, this being resistance and this makes you want to read more and learn how to overcome it. After part one you eagerly await the answers to the problems and right to the end they just don't come.<br /><br />So great start, maybe someone can pick up the slack and provide solutions to resistance",0

FTD &#34;Are you listening?&#34; yes there are sound upgrades on previous releases, but this buyer is waiting for a massive price drop, then i will reconsider, like i have done with the recent box sets.  5 *s for Elvis, but this isnt an essential purchase for me!",0
start it on january 1st had it about a week now and the questions so far have been good.<br />this would make a really good christmas gift so someone can start off the new year filling it out as starting it in july i don't know if when i get to january i'll use the top line or go straight down to the second<br /><br />cover is wonderfully designed and the gold edging to the pages is a really nice touch,1

"Nothing special As a Volbeat fan I still appriciate the album however do not listen to it as much as the early ones. If you like Volbeat the sound will still be good, if you want something that stands out a bit with Volbeat touch, you should go for the early albums.",0

"Decent Enough Film But It Really Needs A Big, BIG screen.... Saw this at the cinema in the 3D and as much as I enjoyed it, I fail to see how even the best home cinema system could ever do this justice!<br />It was an event movie that was carried along on the 3D wave that still shows no sign of abating what with the recent Clash Of The Titans, Sky Sports Football and now talk of The Hobbit in 3D - take that away and place it in the average living room and you are left with a very different beast. An enjoyable movie but one that can only lose so much of it's visual power on a small screen.<br />I will wait at the very least until I have Blu-Ray but even then I cannot really expect to enjoy it the same. It's too bloody long for a start! I think I would watch it in two sessions.<br /><br />I have the same thing with 2012, another movie that looked breathtaking on the big screen and just will not look the same at home so I have left that.<br />Both movies are similiar in that they do not have strong enought scripts or performances to compensate for the loss of the wow factor that inevitably happens at home with an event movie. This couldn't be said for much better movies like Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings or The Star Wars Saga.",0

It gives details about what life was like in Peking just before the Japanese invasion,  especially of the English colony. The author is very well documented. It is a real page turner. I recommend it.",1

One Star bad,0
bat out of hell there are two or three good songs but the rest appear to be dragged out rubbish .{personal opinion only} i gave the item to my daughter who likes it all.,0
"Not one of their best. Even the worlds greatest heavy metal band can make a bad record. This album was critisized by some at the time of release for &quot;not moving from the 80s&quot;, and being &quot;as fresh as a stale fart&quot; ( all true comments), and it's easy to see why.<br />Take the albums title track for example, where you hear Bruce Dickinsons lame attempt at singing a ballad (iron maiden and ballads don't work). Some of the other tracks such as Public Enema#1, and Assassin are cliche ridden and forgettable too.Even Bruces singing voice sounds slightly different to the excellent vocals heard on the previous recordings.<br />At least this album does have 3 good rocking tunes on it-this being Maiden of course.Tailgunner makes a good opener, and the no 1 smash Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter ,and Mother Russia are just classics and deserve top marks. Just a shame the rest of No Prayer---- didn't have more tunes as good as those,as it would've made it a much better record.",0
not bad Could be better. Gets a bit boring after a while.,0

"too long and tedious... i read this book under strong recommendation from my english teacher. i found the first volume exceedingly interesting and i was encaptured by the mystery of the novel, trying to guess who stole the moonstone. HOWEVER the moment the section of the initial mystery finished and the story was moved to london the story became uninteresting and i completely lost interest in the novel. although i finished the novel, i was saddened to found out that the person who stole the diamond was the person i had assumed stolen the diamond from the beginning. i had expected some twists and turns, but apart from the beginning, not worth continuing the novel.",0

FABULOUUS!!! Love this app. Great interactive and very practical visual keep fit moves and  also a keep fit expert explains as you go along with the demonstration.,1
not good I don't like it because of the privacy. My daughter had it and she was only 8 and you could not get like your own privacy so no one could see you. There was a fifteen year old boy and he was swearing but we couldn't call the police because he lived in America we live in England.,0

"Sadly This book is as bad as Eat Pray Love is good! I haven't managed to read past the second chapter. I have found it dull, uninteresting, badly written and rather trite. It doesn't even sound very genuine. She seems to be trying very hard to make a story out of something that just isn't worth it! Maybe I'm being unfair as I have not read it to the end but honestly after several attempts I just could not muster enough enthusiasm to go back to it. What a dissapointment.",0
"Fastway - 'Waiting For The Roar' (Beat Goes On)  3 1/2 stars Haven't heard this disc in ages. First came out in 1985, this was Fastway's third record. Maybe a bit more commercial than the first two - but still good. Tracks that did the most for me were \\""""Tired Of Your Love\\"""", the rocking \\""""Little By Little\\"""", title cut \\""""Waiting For The Roar\\"""", maybe \\""""Girl\\"""" and the uplifting \\""""Doing Just Fine\\"""". Noticed they had a couple of new members this time around - Paul Reid on bass and Alan Connor on drums. Should've known this was an 'original' line-up that wouldn't last very long. I mean, the CD is fine, just not as out-standing as the first two or 'Trick Or Treat' for that matter.",0

Now that's what I call music 86 This compilation isn't as good as the 85 version.I will keep listening and hopeI like it better. The 85 was an instant success with me..<br />I wouldn't really recommend it as it is a bit tedious.,0
"Could have been so much more... I think if I actually cared more about the wooden and clichéd characters, this debut  novel could have been so much more...     But the men are too poorly portrayed, all of them being of a fairly stereotypical breed, and the women don't fair much better either: Tess coming across as the too-good-to-be-true type, and Beatrice being extremely self-absorbed and cold, acting more like an eternal teenager  rather than a woman in her mid-twenties.    The mother was the only one that truly resonated with any emotion and to some extent, Kasia, too.    That being said, despite the overwrought tone of the, the author did occasionally manage to touch me with her words, and I do think some talent shines through, hidden amid the convoluted and, at times,  ludicrous plot.    As for the twists, as others have said, I spotted the murderer practically straight away, so there was no surprise there really. The other twist, though, I loved, and the several tenses used within the story did not confuse me or kill my enjoyment.    Because, despite all this, I did quite enjoy the book, as it was an easy read, with a twist in the end that did it for me. I only wish that the characters could have lived and breathed that little bit more, and if the plot hadn't descended into the realms of disbelief, I would have given 5 stars instead of 3.",0
"upgrade !!! Love this game , like that I can play offline too ...but tells me to upgrade and now can't play ???<br /> Hope it's sorted soon",0
Predictable and Overly Long Great 3D sequences that failed to make an overly predictable movie more watchable. Character development of all the principals was superb but better suited for print media. I was very happy when its 97 minute run time put an end to my misery while proving my predictions for all that followed (SPOILER ALERT) the failed kiss.,0

"Repetitive and nothing special Well if I can get everything off Your website why would I get this book? Things are basic and boring, memorising methods are even more stupid. E.g. &#34;Repeating something 10 or 100 times doesn't work and I would forget it next day&#34; not exact words, but things like this are written poorly and just bores you to death. I want to save my will power and boredom for the actual language learning. Not to mention beginning the book with negatives and common excuses on why some don't want to learn a language. Strong minded and ambitious individuals do not appreciate any bit of negativity.<br /><br />A flashy title and nothing original, this book is for children, those who are not experienced in anything.<br />Very poor but thanks for sharing your experience.",0

"The whole movie is a flawless masterpiece. """"That is the head the tail the whole dam thing"""" From the moment the credit starts and the underwater sounds start and The Jaws music begins.<br />Right up to the part when Brody and Hooper swim into shore after the orca has been destroyed.<br />it has to be the best scariest movie the whole family can watch. It breaks all the rules as it doesn't fall<br />into one genre it falls into every genre. Being a Thriller/horror/action/adventure/drama  with a bit of light humour thrown in.<br />The movie has everything all the characters are likeable the movie is very real and the town is very interesting. The Three<br />leads are superb as they bounce off each other while the giant shark circles there boat and putting them in all kinds<br />of trouble. The first half of the movie is the most scariest upbuilding thrilling drama then the second half is thrown<br />into a superb thrilling adventure and John Williams score is absolutely outstanding. It has to be one of the greatest<br />movies of all time. Definatley in my top 2 movies of all time.",1
Five Stars Loving the  album.,1
"OPETH JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER. OPETH have done it again, another Brilliant Album.",1
"His only album I bought this for his version of Hallelujah - which doesn't disappoint (although I would rate Cohen's and some other's higher). The remainder of the tracks are disappointing and, for me, highlight a less-than-interesting voice with a limited range. I'm no doubt in a minority here, but I would say that his early death has probably contributed to the ratings of this album, for, based on it alone, I cannot place it highly.",0
To negitive I love all of Mika's three previous albums but I do not really like this one.  It has too many slower negative songs in it - the previous albums had a few of these in them as well but they were evened out by the more upbeat and catchy songs in it but this one just does not have this.  As previously said if this a change of direction then fine but not my type of music any more really.,0

"Not exactly what I had expected I enjoyed Brown's latest book \\""""Jedi Academy\\"""" so much I wanted to check out these other two books I had heard so much about.  This was not what I had expected and I only thought it was OK.  A small book filled with one page comic strips featuring what it would have been like for Vader to be a father to Luke when he was a little boy.  An extensive knowledge of Star Wars is needed to get these jokes, especially the original trilogy, with some familiarity of the characters in the new movies also.  I didn't really find any of the comics hilarious, some were cute, some I didn't get and others I just didn't think were funny.  The art on the other hand is very cute and funny.  Vader looks so awkward in his role as \\""""Dad\\"""".  I don't see this as being a book for kids.

Another &#34;Die-Hard&#34; movie set on a plane, this time the saviour of the day is none other than President James Marshall (Harrison Ford), who practically takes down the terrorists led by Ivan Kourshnov (Gary Oldman - on top form as always) threaten destruction unless radical leader Radek (Jurgen Prochnow) is released from prison.<br /><br />Unknown to the terrorists, Marshall is still onboard, after everyone believed he escaped when the terrorists struck, he sets about killing the baddies until he is captured, after innocent people have been murdered.<br /><br />The baddies are defeated eventually, practically moments before the closing credits.<br /><br />Where &#34;AFO&#34; fails, is that its giving out the 'vibe' where the USA is more powerful and invulnerable to enemies - foreign and domestic (let's not forget the Oklahoma Bombing two years previously), the CGI could be better for a big-budget movie, as for the renegade agent (Xander Berkeley - The Rock, Terminator 2), his reason for allowing the terrorists to strike, is never explained.<br /><br />Wolfgang Petersen (The Never Ending Story,  In the Line of Fire), at least tries with &#34;AFO&#34;, but if action-thrillers are going to be made by Hollywood, it should be far better than this, perhaps the saving grace of &#34;AFO&#34; is that it is a pre &#34;9/11&#34; film - if it was made afterwards, forget it!.<br /><br />Patriot Games (1991 - also with Ford), is a far better action-thriller : in many areas!.",0
"over rated!!! axis is a massively dissapointing album overall compared to are you experienced. starts brilliantly with EXP and never recovers, spanish castle magic is decent, the rest are only just struggling to get above average. Only one masterpeice does not make a five star album, the boys were on a totally different level on the first album, mind ripping tracks like i dont live today, third stone from the sun and are you experienced, on axis it sounds as if the music is several bits welded together rather than fully worked, its almost as if someone is holding a gun to the bands head saying dont play anything too exciting, i assume these five star reveiwers WANTED IT TO BE AS GREAT AS THE FIRST, THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THEY MADE ELECTRIC LADYLAND WHICH CAME CLOSE TO THE FIRST ALBUM",0

"Not all that... I really wanted to like this book. The positives - it was a pretty book, nice paper choice and the design was well laid out.<br /><br />Unfortunately I found the content lacking. The approach to knitting in the round was very, very basic and felt it didn't really address some of the more complex issues/techniques (garter in the round using slip stitch???  Considerations of when to knit in round and when you need the structure of seams with yarn weights/types, etc.). The patterns supplied were also very basic and felt a bit outdated.<br /><br />I was let down by what could have been a really interesting book concept, but ended up being ...meh, as the concept wasn't pushed far enough.",0

"Metallica Revisit Old Methods With Successful Results I have mixed feelings about this album. It has obviously done well in the sense that the band have made a better album than their last \\""""2003's St. Anger\\"""". This album is good, good concept, good riffs and lyrics, the only negative things I have to say is that the sound production at times can be too much to handle especially at loud volumes and it feels as though Metallica have just made an album for the fans and it doesn't sound like it came naturally either, it does feel forced. Firstly After the massive uproar after the album Load was released the band stated that they made music for themselves and if you didn't like it you should just stay away. Now it feels as though Metallica have made an album that is trying to imitate their old sound. A band should always do what they want and look to the future. Also the inclusion of The Unforgiven 3 is just clearly an advertising ploy since the Unforgiven and Unforgiven 2 songs were so popular. I would rather listen to a band doing what they want to do not backtracking to earn more money. But with that this album is good, worth a listen. It would have received four stars by the way if the sounds wasn't so terrible. There's only one Metallica album I have given 5 stars - Master of Puppets.",0

I have liked Krokus for a helluva long time and i was looking forward to this....but it is so lacking in any depth or emotion,it just sounds boring and very predictable.

Now he's done it, one of the key sequences at the end of ROTJ (the ghosts) is changed for worse... With all these changes, Lucas doesn't seem to feel any respect for the people that worked for him, but it also seems that he doesn't have any respect for the fans or the viewers either.<br />Don't waste any money on these....",0

"Must read! I've been a fan of The Smiths and Morrissey for a very, very long time. Somehow that's easier to say than decades. In any case, I'm quite familiar with Moz: his lyrical sensibilities, his flair for the dramatic, what he's passionate about, his public persona [since, sadly, I don't know him personally. Though I did get on stage once and danced with him after which he kissed me. Twice :)]. Blah, blah, blah. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, I was concerned that this autobiography was going to be a lot of pretty words and no peek behind the curtain. I was wrong. He doesn't hide behind beautiful prose (though that is there; I actually learned things about him. About his childhood, his adolescence, his experiences!

"That's It? I have I say that I’m extremely disappointed with Thirteen Reasons Why. What’s all the hype about? I know suicide is a touchy subject, but I feel like this story was just so unrealistic. Yes, I said it. You may think I’m crazy, but no, I’m serious.<br /><br />Okay, I know how serious suicide is. It’s such an awful, saddening thing. I thought in this novel, we would learn just how hard it is to be dealing with thoughts of suicide. Well, we didn’t really get into Hannah’s mind and emotions, in my opinion. I really don’t think Jay Asher did a good job at writing a character dealing with suicidal thoughts. Sure, we heard things like “I wish I would just die” in the story, but it’s much deeper than that.<br /><br />It pains me to say this, but I don’t think Hannah’s reasons were legit reasons to kill herself. I think she was a little bit selfish. I don’t want to sound offensive in any way, but sometimes I was just like “Seriously?” I’ll give you an example. I won’t give anything away, but if you’ve read the story then you may, or may not, agree with me that there was someone in a very much worse position than Hannah in Cassette 5, Side B. That other character, Jessica, went through something that other people kill themselves because of. That alone. And that’s just one of the reasons why I think Hannah’s reasons weren’t proper reasons to commit suicide.<br /><br />“You can’t stop the future<br />You can’t rewind the past<br />The only way to learn the secret<br />…is to press play.”<br /><br />This is not a happy story, I’m not trying to say that what Hannah did was silly. I did shed a tear once or twice, but that was after reading. I just think that the idea and layout of Thirteen Reasons Why is so unique, it had the potential. But I was really let down. I’m sure we all know people who’ve committed suicide, whether it was from national news, or more personal. And I think we all can come up with a million reasons why they killed themselves, but none of Hannah’s reasons were serious enough to be believable.<br /><br />I disliked the writing style. It was very simple and some lines were just pointless and made the story line boring. For example, “A drop of warm coffee spills onto my finger. I watch it slide across my knuckles and drip to the floor.” Is that really necessary? At times I didn’t like the way the monologue switched from Hannah to Clay. Sometimes it would only be a paragraph each, maybe even a line! It got a bit tiring.<br /><br />“A lot of you cared, just not enough.”<br /><br />It’s such an upsetting topic to write a novel about, but I feel like someone needs to write one to educate people on how serious suicide is. I was so hoping Thirteen Reasons Why would be that novel, but it wasn’t. Jay Asher should’ve made Hannah’s reasons more severe, more serious, and I know I’ve used that word many times already but it needs to be said.<br /><br />I can’t say I connected with any if the characters in this book, because I didn’t. Sure, there were some characters that I liked and were glad they were in the story, but I never related to any of the characters in any way. And I think the characters should be a bit more relatable for a book like this, aimed at young readers after all.<br /><br />“No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people. Oftentimes, we have no clue. Yet we push it just the same.”<br /><br />There were some lines in the story that I thought really mattered. This is one of them. I liked how there were some meaningful words said in this story. It’s really one of the only things I like about the book.<br /><br />Overall, Thirteen Reasons Why was a disappointment. I really expected a lot more, with all the hype surrounding it. It had potential, it really did. But it needed to be written better, and, well I’ve already explained my reasons for disliking this book. I won’t be reading ThirteenReasons Why again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who hasn’t read it yet.<br /><br />~Jack<br /><br />If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, there is help out there. There are organisations such as Suicide Prevention Ireland or Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you need help, get help.Reasons Why again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who hasn’t read it yet.<br /><br />~Jack<br /><br />If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, there is help out there.

"A bit misleading I have read a couple of Bill's books on recommendation.  These were two of his travel books ('Notes from a small island' and 'A walk in the woods'). I found them very amusing and great reads.  His humour can be dry and his observations and comments I found to be much in the way of Jeremy Clackson.  Based on these experiences and the reviews here and on the sleeve of the book I decided to buy it.  What a disappointment.  I felt let down.  To my mind it is more like a text book than his other observational works.  The alleged 'humour' was not obvious to me and the content considerable and so detailed that I found it a chore to read.  I think that if you are looking for a light amusing read such as 'Notes from a small island' and 'A walk in the woods' then this book is not for you. If however you are interested in language and its origins then this might be worth reading. My experience with this book will not stop me reading other works by Bill, but I will be more critical of reviews before I commit.",0
"Don't put yourself through this.... This is one of those times when I am wishing I had read the 1/2 star reviews before reading the 5 star ones, as I might have saved myself 5.99 & a boring couple of days. Both of the main characters are twits, neither of whom I cared or connected remotely with. Emma was painful & was it me or were they so completly never even remotely likely to be friends? (no doubt someone on here will say 'it's just you' but anyway). Also, Dex. well where to begin, what a complete tool, who I can't believe anyone would want to be friends with (let alone fancy). Chick lit at it's finest. Enjoy if that's what you want, but really take heed (as I wish I'd done)this is drivel of the highest order.",0

Seen this at the cinema today - honestly, I enjoyed it!<br />It's got faults, a little too much CGI here & there and the odd part just a bit OTT but it works.<br />Ford carries the role off superbly! Any faults the film has CANNOT be laid at his door!<br />Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen & Shia Labeouf are all MUCH better than many reviews are making out.<br />The Alien finale works within the context of the film - and how can people accuse this of being far fetched - does everyone take the Bible at face value!?? I would rather have had a biblical theme as opposed to the extra terrestrial/ancient astronauts plot but there isn't one that really stands out! Maybe rebuild The Walls Of Jericho or a quest for Adam's Apple!??!<br />Seriously, Atlantis wouldn't be a bad place to go if a 5th movie is greenlit...<br />The film is action packed, the humour is kept far more in check than the overly comedic Last Crusade & the FX & stunts are excellent (despite the over use of CGI).<br />It's perhaps a little less violent than the previous films as well but still plenty of fist fights (great sound FX once more!), gun battles & a grisly scene with some killer ants.<br />It's no Raiders or Temple Of Doom BUT it's at least as good as The Last Crusade. The odd, unrealistic sepiece doesn't ruin the film despite what you might find on IMDB!<br />Another movie does look likely judging from the closing scenes...",0

"Us & Him Pink Floyd provided the soundtrack to my life; as a 14 year old listening to On The Run through my friend’s hi-fi speakers, as a 21 year old removing the black wrap from the vinyl WYWH and as a 23 year old listening to Animals on my cassette Walkman in Hyde Park.  Pink Floyd provided “moments” and in Rick Wright they provided my musical hero who showed it was possible to be successful without being dictatorial (Roger), charming (David) or simply in the right place at the right time (Nick).  I can still remember Rick’s passing, finding out from a bland Ceefax page on an ordinary afternoon.<br /><br />After the famous early jamming sessions for what would become the Division Bell, each member of Pink Floyd (not sure if extended members were included) gave a score out of ten to each new song.  According to Uncut magazine, Rick gave top marks to all his songs and zero to everyone else’s!  However, the scores from David & Nick ensured that the overall voting process led to the 11 songs that eventually made it on the record.<br /><br />Why is this important?  For me The Endless River is simply those songs which the less biased members of the band gave lower scores to in 1994. There are some fine moments (Rick playing on Autumn 68, Nick cutting loose on Skins) but for the most part this album feels more like a collection of outtakes/demos/alternative versions of past works.  It’s What We do is simply a Shine On outtake, Allonys a Run Like Hell outtake, Talkin Hawkin an alternative Keep Talking and Louder Than Words a poor man’s High Hopes.  In particular Louder Than Words disappoints both lyrically and more surprisingly from the vocals perspective.  I fully respect that David wants to include Polly in the process (she is as much a part of Floyd as Anthony Moore has been for years) but David at least needs to challenge her to go beyond first draft of the lyrics (Diss in a Floyd song ?) .  I would have also preferred to hear David’s second vocal take on the song after he had had a strepsil or two.<br /><br />In the interviews for The Endless River, David seems to have struggled with the whole idea of releasing this material, giving the material to numerous collaborators to make some sense of.  Can you imagine such a process in their heyday?  I can understand his reticence as it must have been a tough decision to honour the memory of his fallen friend versus releasing material which was not good enough for the Division Bell.  For me, this material deserved to be released but as part of a bonus CD on a Division Bell Expanded Special Edition.  This approach would have given the fans more of the Division Bell story, showing a more freestyle approach to listen to alongside the more structured songs like Cluster One and High Hopes.<br /><br />To quote that other old curmudgeonly Englishman, Bagpuss, for all the high polishing and multiple handling, it’s only when it’s time to go to sleep that we really see this album for what it is; a highly polished collection of mostly forgettable songs inspired by a crusty old musician whose star faded before we had a chance to say goodbye. But we all loved him.",0

Don't believe the hype; I bought this after reading the so called reviews and the fact that there appeared to be some awards for the film.

"Misguided - clues is in the title.... Is this titled to suggest it was recorded in a psychiatric hospital?   Meandering collection of very good ideas, but ultimately - singles apart - left wholly undeveloped.  Yessss, I get where you are going guys, and we get the whole tour, ward by ward - Soul, Hip-Hop, Funk, Urban, homages to LIVING COLOR, before full on Brit-Pop and even Dirtbag. But therein lies the problem. Mixing styles does not offend - Prince made a career out of it - failing to do them justice just might and on St. Elswhere there are some fullsome examples.  I'll cite the obvious CRAZY and SMILEY FACES (more clues) as high points and contrast with BOOGIE MONSTER which is late night reheated pizza.

Some latter pieces truly excite, but remain spoiled by the aftertaste left by the earlier less palatable moments.  I think they missed a trick. This still could have had mass appeal, through the thorough execution of genuinely interesting ideas in the way that REM, Run DMC or Terrence Trent D'Arby have done previously.     In the final analyisis...It falls desperately short and is left as a pastiche.   Spent too much on that fantastic video, leaving no budget to finish off the album!",0

"Dissapointed Read this book in a few short hours, not much of a read but OK I suppose. I like her alot but her lifestyle is what shapes her advice and it all seems a bit too front row with Katie Holmes for me, all a bit boring. Took advice of other reviewer here last week and picked up two other style bibles so that I wouldn't misjudge her, How to Walk in High Heels and The Goddess Guide-both great value on amazon and both are full of much better tips and sound advice. How to Walk in High Heels is a good all rounder (I keep it near the TV and flick when I'm bored). The Goddess Guide I keep in my handbag and take it shopping with me for all of the really hip addresses, phone numbers and fashion and beauty tips. I especially like the fashion experts' secret addresses in The Goddess Guide -the ones in London are very special and I've found so many new shops that sell really eclectic one off pieces that had all of my friends guessing where I got my  top (can't wait to try the shops in New York and Paris someday). To be honest I did give Victoria's book a fair chance but it's not anywhere as good as these other two. From reading them I've grasped that the writers spend their whole lives immersed in travelling to critique fashion - you can really tell. Victoria's book misses the mark here because it's just not as believable or savvy. And anyway how can she go shopping on the highstreet for jeans in Topshop without being spotted by the paparazzi? Have you seen the size of the windows on Topshop in Oxford Street?",0
"This is not art What bothers me in this film is that it is , somehow , considered a commentary on fascism and...art . The truth is that this film is just desand's  work in a different environment . The acting is hilarious, esp from the villain characters that act like in a grindhouse movie , some of the scenes are hilariously grotesque (like tapping the girls' behind all night so they can produce a lot of s*** in the morning ) , the cinematography is mediocre and the only good thing is the music . Pasolini was a known degenerate who was passing his fantasies on his films and that is considered by some critics' circles art just like Lars Von trier . Mind you that I have no problem with disturbing movies at all and I have watched way worse than salo and I have a strong stomach .<br />The problem is that this abomination is a mockery to movies that truly show what fascism , in its various forms, really is (like some of kostas gavras' movies ) .<br />You want to watch the fantasies of a person like Pasolini , then this movie is for you . You want to watch movies that make you think about them after their finale , then try something  else .",0
"Dire and Irrelevant The setting seems to be a rehearsal room, what I presume to be villagers are lined up with a conductor. Other characters sit at tables. Some ladies put skirts on over their everyday clothes. This also includes Dessay who has a dress fitting whilst singing her opening aria. The conductor of the choir seems to be Alessio.<br />Lisa is sitting at a table writing invitation cards or something. Then Florez appears, hold on I am going on a bit. This seems to be a rehearsal, a complete distraction from the story. What is Zimmerman thinking of? This story does not gel. When the wedding is called off the chorus start ripping music scores up and throw bits of costume about, extract the prompter from her pit and rough her up a bit.<br />A word about the singers, Florez is on form, Dessay unusually screetches a few top notes. The others are all adequate, I found it helped to close my eyes, I should treat it as a CD.<br />Oh well, in act two the shady forest is the same set, with dim lights, the chorus have a sit down, tired from the ripping and throwing of act one I presume. They double as cleaners leaving only one stage hand who looks at his watch, I know the feeling.<br />In the sleepwalking scene, Amina is walking on the window ledge outside the building, she is retrieved safely.<br />For the final happy reconciliation suddenly everyone gets into costume!<br />It seems a shame that these artists have appeared in this production, it is not worthy of them.",0
"awful service The Book is a good read. However the way in which it is printed is not amazing but still good. The delivery service for this product is AWFUL!!! I never write reviews but I was absolutely disgusted by the slow delivery! It took nearly three weeks to get to me, I wondered if it was even going to come. Get this product only if you are able to wait for weeks, if your in a hurry I suggest another seller. By the way I don't live overseas but in London, so they have no excuse for not delivering on time!",0
"Akira Bought this on the cheap due to recommendations. It's not bad, but not as good as I expected. The animation is wonderful and I love the styling of it. Characters were kinda meh and the plot was pretty meh. Felt underwhelmed by the ending. Worth it for the price though, but it's not spectacular. Not one that I'm going to re-watch in a hurry, unfortunately.",0

"Great album, great remaster. The album, which featured the true power and talent of the group. It was on &#34;Fragile&#34; team first made itself felt as one of the world's art-rock, what can we say - the whole rock music. There are virtually no drawbacks, much more interesting stuff previous works. The idea was to combine the records sufficiently long track solo numbers of each participant. I must say, most of these solos are not particularly worked out nice exception is the only song of Steve Howe, played on acoustic guitar, however, the thing squire &#34;The Fish&#34; is not too bad. As for the joint creation, they are very good: the instrumentalists shine in all its glory, hitting his findings, moreover, sometimes using techniques of jazz-rock, and Anderson finally raspelsya, as clearly evidenced by the song &#34;Heart of Sunrise&#34;, which perfectly combines the rigidity of instruments and vocals deep lyricism. Certainly, this is one of the best songs of the group. Of the songs can be identified more &#34;Roundabout&#34;, which finally took Yes popularity lists. Should also be said about the sound of the album: it is quite tough and dirty (in art-rock standards), which is not observed in the subsequent works team. The result: an album certainly was the starting point for the creation of such consummate masterpieces as &#34;Tales From Topographic Oceans&#34; and &#34;Relayer&#34;, in which his ideas were developed and improved, but still different from them, and has value in itself.",1

A fab game It's amazing there is no word  why isn't its really fun and you can get<br />cool stuff on it. And the more coins you get on it the more you play it . And after a few hours you get more coins. I would say it would be 7-83.,1

"Disappointing My Mum unually put this book to one side for me after reading it herself, lending it to 2 of her sisters and her best friend.  I guess I now know my place on her list! ha ha.  As it was SO out of charactor for to advise me on a book she thought I would like, I made the \\""""effort\\"""" to show willing and read it.  For me reading is something that I do get into from time to time, but I wasn't in that zone.    I just hated the book, I didn't like the way it was written, that I was expected to beleive that a 14yr old would have that use of language, and the way it jumps around all over the place, this had nothing to do with the subject matter or my belief system, far from it.  I just found it SO boring, and the twist at the end is just so ridiculas and farsical it pushed it boundaries TOO far.    I wouldn't recommend it, and should people wish to find comfort in loss, then read ANYTHING by Gordon Smith listed on Amazon, you will get something genuine and beautiful, the only way this would keep you warm is by setting fire to it!",0

"A Missed Opportunity I'm not going to lie; I'm almost never a fan of biblical stories being adapted into movies. Whether you're religious or not, everyone interprets the bible differently, and it's a touchy subject for most. But lately, with &#34;Son of God&#34; and the upcoming &#34;Exodus: Gods and Kings&#34;, this popular genre seems to be in abundance. Included in this recent batch of films is Darren Aronofsky's &#34;Noah&#34;, which looked to be more fresh and interesting than the others, but ended up being a huge missed opportunity.<br /><br />Starring Russell Crowe as the classic title character, we see him experience a vision foretelling a great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every existing animal, along with him and his family. With the help of a race of angels called The Watchers, we follow his treacherous, and often boring, journey to fight off the wicked and protect his loved ones.<br /><br />As epic as it may have looked, the movie never delivers. Heavily straying from the source material, and not in a good way, it felt like a mash-up of ideas that never really came together. Rated PG-13 for violence, &#34;Noah&#34; relied on style rather than substance.",0

"Style over substance. Watch the first 30 minutes and then stop watching the film otherwise rue the day you wasted a couple of hours of your life.  The word to describe this film? Pretentious.  The first 30 mins is visually spectacular though it does seem to be a series of shots stolen from the BBC nature department and all that was missing was Attenborough's voice over.  The film itself is a soul crushing journey of boredom which grinds on the will to live.  Sure, come to your very own conclusions to what the film hopes to achieve but I for one grew tired of the endless shots of the main character looking puzzled and baffled whilst time stands still and nothing happens.  As for the last 10 or so minutes, well it's all a load of nonsense but make of it what you will.  The characters are eternally boring (especially the mother who whispers her way through the film). Dull, dull, dull.  But as I said before, pretentious is the perfect word to describe this travesty.  And can anyone explain the bit with the dinosaurs? Especially the scene by the river.  A dinosaur lies by the river, another dinosaur comes along and puts it's foot on the other dinosaurs head, does nothing and then runs off.  Pure drivel.",0
"Great! Even though there was a bit of a glitch where it randomly made me start again, it is still by far my favourite game on my kindle. I love the events that you can compete with others in and win cool things for your farm. I rate this five because there is always fun to be had no matter what stage or level you  are!",1
Shambolic. I must be missing something in this film because I thought it was incomprehensable and shambolic from begining to end. How can Ryan Gosling be an unhinged student when at the beginning of the film he is clearly almost dead on Brooklyn Bridge with the other two main characters who clearly didnot know each other or him?????,0

"Disappointing Initially I resisted this book, as I do all overhyped novels.  However, curiosity won out in the end.  I had difficulty getting into the story because of the superficial introduction of the characters and setting.  I felt I did not believe in this strange household.  Then I became more involved and began to think that perhaps it merited its popularity.  Even so, some of the writing does not flow, impeded by clunky choice of descriptive adjectives and metaphors.  At times, the author seems to be saying &#34;look, aren't I clever!&#34;.  I am now reaching the end of the book and the plot has become so improbable that it's hard to find a reason to read on.  I think the weakness of the book lies in the characterization.  We never get to know these characters deeply enough to understand their, often irrational,  actions.  Like the miniature figures, they are not real in the sense that well-written characters are real to the reader.  A better plot would have brought the characters to life.  Instead, they remain the author's puppets.",0

"Read it in under 24 hours. Doesn't mean I liked it! Dan Brown.    I first heard the name during a lecture at university, where my lecturer called 'The DaVinci Code' \\""""the new Bible!\\"""". Perhaps this was not the best introduction to Dan Brown I could have, but it certainly put me off the sensationalism. My belief is that Brown does ample research for his books, and the Robert Langdon books in particular, show the fruit of this research.    'Angels and Demons', and 'The DaVinci Code', then, became bestsellers due to the ease with which the author guides us through popular places and artworks in Italy and France. His prose does not shine, but his ability to clearly intrigue the reader with the vaguest of clues, does. I had read Brown's non-Langdon novels, and did not enjoy them as much, purely due to the far-fetched scientific claims he makes. It is hard to distinguish what Brown, himself, truly believes.     Thus, we have this theme of science vs. art. I believe that Brown fully understands the latter, and wades his way through the former. \\""""The Lost Symbol\\"""" enforces this belief.       * Characters   If you have read either of the other Langdon novels, you will probably know what to expect. Langdon teams up with a Clever, Brave, Sexy Scientist and together, they try to thwart the Fanatic Lunatic Deranged Criminal, whether he is covered in tattoos or hits himself with a holy whip. Supporting characters, such as the Old Disabled Mentor (two of which feature in this novel!), and Government Agent Who Has A Hidden Agenda also feature.    The problem is that all these characters are very one-dimensional. They all go through various \\""""twists\\"""", but.. ultimately emerge exactly the same. They are there only for Langdon to impress us with his exposition, but with every book that Brown publishes, Langdon loses some humanity, and ends up sounding more like an insufferable know-it-all.    I didn't care for any character in this book. The villain has by far the most interesting (and far-fetched) background, but even then- no emotions. Whether characters live or die didn't affect me, and this is not a good thing. This is Langdon, the \\""""hero\\""""'s, third book. Surely by now I should have some kind of attachment to him? It seems not...       * Setting  A Langdon novel set in Washington D.C.! I had never visited Italy or France prior to reading the other novels, but the places there were described in detail that this novel was not. Whereas previously Brown described with care the cities and places Langdon visited, immersing his reader in a lush landscape, now he simply assumes we know where Langdon is going. There is no sense of direction or distance - as a non-American, and someone who has never visited Washington, I can safely say I have no idea where Langdon went, what places he visited, and why his revelations were so important.      * Style/Prose  The reason I got through the book so quickly is due to the short chapters (there are over a hundred in the book), each ending with some sort of cliffhanger. These cliffhangers quickly become old, and unnecessary - this is not a TV series, but a book. The next chapter starts on the same page, not next week!    Example:    Chapter Ends with \\""""..and he saw her flying through the air emitting a soundless scream.\\""""  Next Chapter Starts with \\""""She had fallen over a chair and landed on the floor.\\""""    The cliffhangers feel too forced. I would never describe someone tripping over a chair as \\""""flying through the air\\"""", and I would not expect a bestselling author to do so either.      * Finally..  The ending was not worth reaching. There is no real \\""""discovery\\"""" of an artefact, no \\""""climax\\"""". Instead, the end consists of a good 30+ pages of pure exposition and back-story. Very lame, for a book that opens with a severed hand impaled on a stick!      I rate this book two stars. It wasn't bad, but after the success Brown has seen, I expected more from his fifth outing. Perhaps it is time to retire Langdon, and try out a different lead character. Until then I will continue to read -but not expect to enjoy - this book.",0

"Amadeus - my impression  of the 1984 DVD I thouhgt it was  outstanding,  It also gave me a strong base and background to the story from which to see the production of Amadeus at the Chichester Festival Theatre two weeks ago.  The Jonathan Church interpretation of Peter Shaffer's play was also outstanding, with riveting performances from Rupert Everett as Salieri and Joshua McGuire as Motzart.  Whilst I am writing I would like to say how impressed I was with the efficient way you dealt with my request for the DVD. Whilst I appreciate that I paid a little more for the early delivary of the DVD, Nevertheless It arrived wiithin 24hours of my order being processed, that was very impressive, together with the appropriate paperwork via your Email system, and with the DVD itself.

"Rush release This is the last Deep Purple in my collection (I have all the others up to, and including, 'Stormbringer'). The inclusion of the cover of 'River Deep...' had previously put me off, as I've never liked the song. Unfortunately, of all the versions I've heard, this is one of the worst. They also murder a Beatles song here. What I didn't realise until I read the sleevenotes was that this was recorded only three months after the debut album. No wonder they were struggling for material. Fortunately, the original stuff is very good. The instrumental 'Wring That Neck' and 'Shield' are good rock numbers, as is the appropriately named 'Anthem'. The half-sung, half-recited opening track complete with vocal effects is an oddity which works well on the whole. A third cover, Neil Diamond's 'Kentucky Woman' surprisingly has much of the gusto of classic period Deep Purple too, while the bonus tracks are worthwhile, if slightly inferior to the best of the main album. Worth buying if you're a Deep Purple fan, I think, but put it well down your list.",0

"Really boring Book Juast finished the book, really boring. has no proper sequence. the story runs really slow.     the book must have been a \\""""bestseller\\"""", coz of the author. just cant understand how did it receive bestseller status?",0
"I wonder if I am holding the same book. I seem to be in a minority, but I think the book is very disappointing.<br /><br />The page design inside the book is quite ugly and magazine-like.  It's divided roughly into four unrelated sections:  a huge preamble about Skyward Sword; a chronology; concept artwork; and a short comic - all with different page layouts.  This is not a coherent book which thematically explores the mythos of Hyrule (as you might think the name implies).<br /><br />Strangely, the commentary that goes with the concept artwork is usually speculative, making the book feel rather unofficial.<br /><br />\\""""For some reason, this concept art depicts Telma's cat riding on Darbu's shoulder.  It seems that, initially, the feline played a role in his story.\\"""" - p. 189<br /><br />It's odd to constantly see phrases like \\""""for some reason\\"""" and \\""""it seems\\"""" in an allegedly official book, where you would hope to find an authoritative insight into past ideas and dropped storylines/concepts.<br /><br />There is a lot of concept art, usually reproduced very small, without much information about it.  For an oversized book I wonder why they didn't make any double-page (or even full-page) spreads of the artwork.<br /><br />There is also a huge difference between the coverage of different games, from the 66-page opening section about Skyward Sword, to only 10 pages dedicated to Ocarina and Majora's Mask combined.<br /><br />The Hyrule Historia is a vaguely interesting thing to flick through, but I would describe it neither as an \\""""art book\\"""" nor of a particularly high quality.  It doesn't add anything to the world of Hyrule, rather it slightly devalues its magic.",0
"Boring read, don't bother I have read every one of Pareicia Cornwell's books.  Her books have been getting steadily worse and are not a patch on her early books.

The fill ups were also excellent and it is good to be able to choose ... Once again this was a very successful CD.I felt that both the performance and recording were of a very high standard and would strongly recomend this recording to anyone looking for a superlative modern account of this concerto. The fill ups were also excellent and it is good to be able to choose a main work without duplicating another violin concerto already owned.,1

"Emperors new clothes If this book hadn't been hyped so much, I might have given it some slack, like 2 stars.  However, it is awful.  Pretentious to the nth degree.  It lacks any subtlety, poetry and has very little humanity.  It is a caricature, not insightful in any way.  Got the idea yet.  I hated it and I forced myself to finish the entire mess because I continually thought that it must have some salient point to make.  It doesn't.  Avoid it and use the time for something better.",0

The Originals better by far in a league of it's own. Well first off I'm a huge fan of the original. So this movie was doomed to fail unless it steered in the same direction. Which it did for a short time then the new ideas to put the plot and story line across changed. Witch Craft or Voodoo theme attached I didn't like. The actors when changed were not that good and didn't do much to the living. They didn't seem much of a threat like the original movie. Plus not enough gore and blood for what the films based from.<br /><br />Especially when Bruce Campbell was involved in the making of the film. I would of thought you lived this film 20+ years ago. So i expected better.,0
Predictable It was ok but I wouldn't rush out to recommendit to my friends. It was a bit predictable and I could see the ending coming a mile away.,0

"Disappointing I picked this book after reading Robin Lane Fox's \\""""Classical World\\"""" thinking that, as it's short and compact, it would allow me to keep my knowledge of Greek civilisation somewhat fresh without having to re-read Lane Fox's quarter of a million word tome. I was sorely disappointed though. The book is far too short to even attempt to achieve the scope of Cartledge's ambition for it. There are 208 pages of main text in my copy, but this is reduced to about 190 pages of narrative when maps and other illustrations are taken in. Also, the individual lines are extremely short and generously spaced, further reducing the space available for expostion. I know people will argue that the book is supposed to be short and compact, that as Cartledge himself notes, it's a breviarum rather than an epitome, but I don't think that's a good enough reason for the paucity of material. If it was impossible to relate the minimum that needed to be related, then either the project should have been abandoned, or expanded. As it is, it gives only the most vague, unsatisfactory sense of Greek civilisation.     In discussing Cnossos for example, there is absolutely no mention of the eruption of Santorini which lead to the collapse of the \\""""palace\\"""" civilisation of the island. The book purports to tell the \\""""history\\"""" of 11 cities, yet one would think on that basis that Athens ceased to be after the 4th century BC, and only re-emerged in the 19th century AD. Indeed, for all the cities up to those covered in the Hellenistic section, there is barely a sentence to mention their existence after the 4th century.    Furthermore, the decision to enchew a chronolgoical or thematic narrative for what amounts to a geographical one, bears frustrating fruit. For example, when discussing Sparta, Cartledge makes a subtle hint at the diminuation of their power in the mid 4th century, but one has to wait 50 pages until the chapter on Thebes to read about the decisive battle of Leuctra, in which the Spartans were defeated. It's ironic in light of this, that Cartledge gives so much to the laconicism of the Spartans themselves.     All in all, I couldn't reccommend this book to anyone. For a neophtye, there is nowehere near enough information, and for anyone with even a cursory knowledg, there is nowhere near enough expostion. By attempting to cram an entire history into such a brief few pages, Cartledge falls between two stools. It's a great pity because he writes with great verve and energy, and obviously brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to bear on the subject.",0

"Not impressed at all. Only 3 stars from me. What with all the fuss about how wonderful Le Carre is I decided to finally read a book of his. I'm not a great fan of spy novels I have to say so I won't comment on the plot. I think Le Carre operates a very nice standard of English which I think is a bit wasted on the subject matter he writes about. It's not terribly well edited. The nowadays rarely used word \\""""alacrity\\"""" is used 3 times and twice in close vicinity to each other (while this literary word is still hovering at the back of your memory having read it a minute before) and brings unnecessary attention to it. Moreover, far too many people in the book feel \\""""skittish\\"""" or preform tasks \\""""skittishly\\"""". The ending is a bit disappointing. I wonder whether it reflects some current anti-American feelings of the author. Finally, the relationship between Issa and Annabel: exactly, what relationship? All of a sudden the narrator talks of a \\""""untouchable lover\\"""" etc? How did this come about? I just find it really poor and annoying. So overall I reckon 3 stars is all Le Carre gets.",0

"what happened?! there are so many albums that i've felt were overlooked in favour of average ones with a huge financial push but this is the first time i've felt compelled to comment on any record in print. i am so disappointed. the foo's have always charmed the pants off me in the past but this really is dire. bland in the extreme. 't.c.a.t.s' is a flawed album but it's merely adequate songs only served to emphasize shards of perfection like 'my hero', 'hey! johnny park' and (obviously) 'everlong'. over the expanse of it's 2 discs, 'i.y.h' really has nothing to rival these highs. nothing that would even be rectified by chopping it down to a single cd. i loved the 'N' word band and have always found gems on 'f,f's' albums in the past despite some being less than perfect but this really is a rapid decline that i take no pleasure in voicing my opinion on. try Alkaline Trio, Weezer, Jimmy Eat World and Green Day's last births if you're looking for good, veteran, bands who have really hit their stride with their latest releases. sorry to fans. i used to be one too.",0
"A Book Of Two Halves... Harry Hole vs. Historical I am someone who has to read a series of novels in order, this does only apply to a series I don't have to read an authors works in order at all. `The Redbreast' is the earliest of the Harry Hole novels to have been translated from the original Norwegian and so it seemed the ideal place to start. As we meet Harry Hole for the first time he does something which could leave him without a job, as he accidentally shoots a secret agent he believes is an assassin, instead however due to the circumstances he actually gets a promotion which puts him in the path of another mystery as a rare and unusual gun seems to have come into the country. What could someone possibly want with such a weapon and how could it be used?<br /><br />I have to say when this turn of events seemed to become more and more apparent I was beginning to think `oh no, I am not sure this assassin stuff is going to really be my kind of crime novel' yet as Nesbo carries out Harry's story he interweaves two other perspectives. One is again in the present day and sees an elderly gentleman acting most ungentlemanly in many ways both dealing with those on the wrong side of the law and also in murderous ways. We also get a very interesting back story set in 1944 (and becomes like a separate tale of love) which Nesbo weaves and alternates on and off throughout the modern day tale combining a tale of the Nazi's in the war with neo-Nazi's in the present.<br /><br />In fact in some ways it's this rather different way of telling and setting up a crime novel that made it stand out. Before anyone jumps on that I am aware other authors will have done these historical tricks but this did actually feel different it was like reading a historical literary novel in some ways as well as a crime novel. I did occasionally find that Harry Hole, whilst interesting enough, was never quite fully drawn and riddled with those great modern crime detective clich&eacute;s. He likes his drink, he doesn't seem to relate to anyone else that he works with, he can't seem to hold a relationship down, is a bit of a loner. I also didn't find it as page turning as I had been initially promised as I was occasionally confused at what was going on with which of the many characters. But I was hooked in and did read it fairly quickly just taking a breather now and again to make sure I had caught up with it all in my old head. I cant say too much about the plot either because of this and because I don't want to give too much away as I did guess how everything interlinked before Nesbo officially let me in on it.<br /><br />I cannot say that `The Redbreast' is the best crime novel that I have read, and indeed I have read some recently that far surpass it, but it's a series I now want to read much more of. To say he is `the new Stieg Larsson' I think actually discredits Nesbo (and not just because I didn't get on with The Millennium Trilogy) because in the historical sections of the novel he has created something quite wonderful and unusual in the crime genre and I am left wanting to know if the rest of the series is as different. It's a novel of two very different halves, both very good in their own ways, which Nesbo combines and weaves together until the finale.can't seem to hold a relationship down, is a bit of a loner.

The story was too long and it had no thrill or chill, I don't even know what category to put it in to. I said to myself while watching it 'there must be something, there has to be something' but there was nothing. Even my sister who really wanted to watch it fell asleep.

"Way worse than previous books This novel from Dan Brown goes over the top by combining everything (culture/religion/symbols) with anything possible. Action is fast paced, but the story itself soon looses any hint of credibility. Brown brings all possible spiritual things together trying to convince reader that they are all the same. It ends up in the complete mess and mishmash. I was indeed struggling in the end as the story became so incredulous.     I enjoyed a lot his previous book (especially Digital Fortress and Da Vinci Code) but this book is really disappointing.",0

"Saublöd In a nutshell:    I've had so many recommendations for 'The Book Thief' that I finally succumbed to temptation. No matter what the story (which is not particularly interesting), the prose was just abominable! Anybody who claims that this book is 'beautifully written' has obviously read few good books. I didn't think it moving at all, just preposterous. Apart from that the German is faulty, so the author was even too lazy for proper research!    Maybe a 'Saukerl' would enjoy this book!",0
"I love it I love it.... I think it is a little piece of art. The book, by the great, classic English writer, Charles Dickens, is already a piece of art in  itself actually, and the addition of the artistic  pop-ups by Chuck Fischer makes it,a charming and wonderful item for a good gift",1

"Epic Finale part 1 Acting more as mood setter for the big finale this chapeter can sometimes plod where it should really be soaring. There are some fun moments and the journey that the trio embark on is akin to Lord of The Rings albeit on a much smaller, less melodarmatic scale.<br /><br />The problem is you watch the film knowing that the big battle is ahead so when this one abrutly ends your left feeling rather hollow. The action that is in this film is great and a good indicator of things to come. It is dark and it is moody much like the previous sequels.<br /><br />Deathly Hallows part one suffers from being the film nobody wanted. With the stunning part two casting a rather large shadow this one gets a little lost. Well worth a watch but dont expect any fireworks.",0

"Dona Tartt again not at her best... When \\""""The Goldfinch\\"""" was first published, I read so many bad reviews that, having been strongly disappointed by Dona Tartt's earliest opus \\""""The Little Friend\\"""", I decided not to buy or read it. Then, a dear friend of mine received this book as a gift, read it and liked it a lot, and lent it to me, urging me to read it. So I did.  Some reviewers criticized the book for being too long. Personally, I don't mind; I tend to read fast, so I like very thick books, where I feel I can spend some time with the characters, they become like familiar friends and I like to go along with them and learn what is happening in their lives. Theo, in this sense, is a very endearing person, wrecked by his mother's terrible death, struggling to adapt to life with the Barbours (great description of the psyches of the whole family, especially Mrs Barbour), and all this to be ultimately torn from this family and his beloved New York by his irresponsible father who dumps him in Las Vegas. Contrary to some reviewers, I liked the Las Vegas part of the book and did not think it was too long or meaningless: the contrast between the life in NY and in those gloomy deserted suburbs is very aptly described and full of atmosphere. Intriguing, too, and essential for the rest of the book, is the unlikely friendship that Theo strikes immediately with Boris,, crucial for the rest of the story.  Later on, our Theo returns to NY and goes to live and work with Hobie, a charming man and wizard craftsman. There is also the frustrating love of Theo for Pippa, this marvelous and elusive young girl: how sweet would it have been to see those two together, in love with each other.  So far, so good.  But, after about 600 pages, Ms Tartt does not seem to really know how to bring the book to a satisfying conclusion, and that's where the story takes a very different, and to me, totally wrong turn: doubtful and obnoxious Russian, Ukrainian and German characters start to sprout like mushrooms from every other page, the story turns into a sort of bad US thriller series, complete with a depressing depiction of Amsterdam, mysterious meetings, even more mysterious bad guys popping up from nowhere, a shooting in a garage, Boris disappearing from the picture (no pun intended!) entirely for days and reappearing with a totally unlikely and very sketchy story of a ring of art thieves dismantled in Germany, invaluable paintings recovered and returned to their rightful owners, big reward, etc: all is well that ends well. The ending being wrapped up in a few pages of Theo's philosophical considerations about art, love, etc, which sound as a contrived effort from Ms Tartt to give her work a kind of literary flavor.  To summarize, although I found it hard at times to empathize with Theo (especially his drug abuse, of which we are spared no detail), I was happy for him when he was able to leave Las Vegas and return to NY to live with Hobie. But then, the story started to be more and more laborious and showed a total lack of direction, to the point of incoherence. Overall, I was disappointed with this book, but not surprised given Dona Tartt's failures at a good story in \\""""The Little Friend\\"""". If she ever produces a fourth book 10 years from today, I do not intend to even give it a try. And I think I'm fairly generous in giving her 3 stars instead of 2.",0

"Rebus and the A9 It is hardly surprising that Ian Rankin could not resist bringing former DI John Rebus back, here in \\""""Standing in Another Man's Grave\\"""" (2012) and in \\""""Saints of the Shadow Bible\\"""" (2013), a book I look forward to reading.  Rebus is almost irresistible as a character: a hard-boiled detective type, invented in the United States but given a tough Scottish edge over twenty-five years of Rebus books.  And kept up to date, less in the types of crime portrayed -- these remain a mix of the violent and bizarre -- and more in the changes in policing.  In \\""""Standing in Another Man's Grave\\"""", there is a clash with Rankin's more recent lead-character, Malcolm Fox, head of \\""""the Complaints\\"""", the internal investigation service which pursues corrupt police officers, and also, less aggressively, with two upwardly-mobile male-officers, both of whom could easily be middle-managers in a corporation, and a more sympathetic, smart but still orthodox very senior officer, a woman. Between Rebus and these police officers, Rankin locates Siobhan Clarke, Rebus' former colleague and now promoted herself to DI.  She is the value-centre of the novel.  For his come-back, Rebus is a civilian in the equivalent of the cold cases unit featured regularly on British television in a series called \\""""New Tricks\\"""", but he gets seconded to his old detective unit at Gayfield Square when he spots a possible connection between a very old cold case and a series of recent and current murders.  The connection turns out to be a road, the A9, and some mysterious photographs of landscapes in the far north of Scotland.<br /><br />Bringing a character back runs the risk that the character becomes over-exaggerated, in effect the raison d'être for the novel.  In \\""""Standing in Another Man's Grave\\"""" this is a shortcoming, to the degree that the story constantly needs to accommodate Rebus in his semi-official role, and he is the least accommodating of characters. Again, Clarke is central and, in the rather contrived but still exciting conclusion, she opts for Rebus' way, as more \\""""fun\\"""" than that of the bureaucrats. Mostly, though, the wonderful dialogue between Rebus and other characters, particularly Clarke, carries the sometimes awkward story. Rebus can be very funny, indeed, though, here, the humour additionally highlights Rebus getting older but certainly not more temperate, as he faces up to the prospect of complete retirement.  Interestingly -- given Rebus' preference for face-to-face contacts over electronic ones -- the story is taken forward by a succession of texts and calls made on and to Rebus' mobile, together with the contribution made to the investigation by a young female detective, who is an expert with various forms of social media.  The critical meetings, though, are with his old adversary Big Ger Cafferty, and other gangsters.<br /><br />Aside from the pleasure of hearing Rebus comment on new ways of doing things and on the people who surround him, particularly in the police force, the greatest achievement of \\""""Standing in Another Man's Grave\\"""" has to do with the geography of the A9 and its environs. Rankin catches the life of that road: the interminable road works and the mix of Scottish and East European workers; the criss-crossing of the far north by lorry drivers and travelling salesmen, one, in particular, selling \\""""solutions\\"""", a notion that intrigues Rebus; and the stopping places: cafes, hotels, pubs and bars, and petrol stations. Then there is the sublime scenery of the Highlands, which contrasts with the dreary built environment yet is also the site of burials and the shallow grave of the title.  Rankin's choice of title is cleverly caught up with the plot and with Rebus' return, replete with his deeper worries about what lies ahead for him through and after retirement.  As such, the title plays to the return of Rebus and, to that extent, underplays the compelling portrayal of Scottish urban, sub-urban and rural society, and the road which connects them.n, sub-urban and rural society, and the road which connects them.",0

"out of date science Review of ‘a universe from nothing’.<br /><br />A rendering of the history and development of physics and its application to cosmology over the last one to two hundred years or so, to enlighten ourselves on how the universe came into being. The author, scientist Lawrence M. Krause, bombs us along on a journey of discovery, exploring his personal understanding of how the universe may have come about from absolutely ‘nothing’, using both quantum physics and the theory of relativity. Incidentally, these two separate theories have never been proved to actually work together but nevertheless he thinks they could, somehow, eventually, maybe.  Anyway, he then explains how astrophysics has determined our universe to be ‘flat’, meaning in a trillion years or so of increasing expansion it will be so dispersed no astronomer living then will ever hope to see the same galaxies we see today. Neither will they have any notion of the ‘Big Bang’ ever happening. This is all fascinating stuff providing a picture of the universe’s inevitable depressing and lonely end. Having said that, much of what is written here is a little out of date now, even packing off the poor old ‘Creator’, which seemed unreasonable, for surely a ‘Creator’ could have come from ‘Nothing’ also.  Mr Krause unfortunately loses the argument here, ceasing to be scientific and running off into fantasy land. The book’s main objective suddenly seemed to be about dispensing with belief in any creative force. Yes, you have it, Mr Krause is an atheist and to back the crusade invites along fellow atheist Mr Richard Dawkins, to review the book in a supportive afterword.<br /><br />This is all very well, one atheist supporting another but the point to be made here is that scientifically, the Big Bang theory remains only a theory even today, still under revision by the scientific community on the basis the old views have changed somewhat because of relevant new findings. It is still unclear howthe universe started and if whether the universe is flat or not. Embarrassing for a scientist to use immature unproven platforms to try justifying atheist views. That is not scientific and I am not impressed, not that I am a member of any Christian or religious community mind, so judge these comments without bias or prejudice, finding his challenge remarkably pathetic and churlishly arrogant. This is not unlike how the Catholic Church once attacked science back in the 14th century.<br /><br />As the scientist Max Planck, founder member of Quantum Physics, pointed out, ‘Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve’. Another way of expressing this is how Buddhist scholar Alan Watts expresses problems of attempting to define the mystery of consciousness, ‘A bit like trying to bite your teeth with your teeth.’<br /><br />Science should not be used to employ dogma, surely it is there to learn with open mind and decide nothing is fact until absolutely proven? On the basis given I cannot really recommend this book, especially to science undergraduates.",0

"I am insulted by this book This book was bought for me as a present and I vowed to read it to the end. Oh how I wish I hadn't. The gimmicky structure is quite clearly a device to hide the utter lack of any intelligence or originality. The writing itself, as in the sentence structure, is workmanlike and nothing more. The stories, of which the novel is made up, lack interest with vapid formulaic plots that fail to captivate.  Shakespeare was famous for stealing old stories and then imbuing them with human insight, wit, and vision, and thus creating works of genius. Mitchell has taken old stories and imbued them with a sense of dreary, slogging, mud befowled, empty headedness that turns every page into an effort. Indeed if I were to describe this novel in a single word I may choose boring. However, because I vowed to finish the book, and therefore wasted several weeks of my life while it languished on a shelf due to my utter despair at the prospect of having to pick the wretched thing up again, I was personally insulted that the author had wasted so much of my time with this thoughtless shambles. So instead I will choose the word insulting.  If you enjoy having a half-wit bombard you relentlessly with half-baked philosophy, and repeat verbatim ideas he has heard from other hafl-wits then this is the book for you. They don't rate highly on my list of pleasurable activities, so this wasn't the book for me.  Why was this published?  Was it ever looked at by an editor?  Who are the people who have given it such wondeful reviews?  I can only imagine they are people of very limited reading not to have noticed the wholesale lifting of ideas that were outdated before I was born.  If I could send a telegram to David Mitchell, in the forlorn hope that he may read it, it would say; \\""""I have read your book stop Please stop please please please stop\\"""" (yes I stole that joke, but it's a good joke and is worth repeating, unlike the entire contents of \\""""Cloud Atlas\\"""").  Having finally made it to the finish line, Idid feel a sense of elation, but this wasn't brought on by the book. It was simply the joyous prospect of never having to read anything that Mr. Mitchell writes ever again.  \\""""Free at last, free at last, thank god almighty I'm free at last\\"""" is the inscription on Martin Luther King's tombstone.  I know how he feels.",0

"Poor quality vinyl pressing In my experience Dig-a-log with Lilith album pressings are very low quality with heavy distortion at both high and low ends of the frequency range. I've purchased two albums, the other is Zuckerzeit by Cluster, and they both suffer with poor audio quality. As most collectors know, vinyl is not cheap at £20 to £30 an album these days. I learnt the expensive way; parting with nearly £50 for two great albums that I can't listen to. I must hasten to add that I'm not in the retail record business. I'm just trying to alert potential purchasers to the possible pitfalls of new pressings. Buyer beware & be vigilant to save from disappointment.",0

"Cobblestony old Europe (set in Luxembourg) e-book version Welcome to Luxembourg.We have been keen to read this novel, as it is set mainly in Luxembourg, and there are not many books set there that really bring the city to life (as far as our researches have thrown up, that is!).This is a thriller, with echoes of the film, Mr and Mrs Smith, set in the heart of Europe, with forays to Paris, Munich, Avoriaz, and Amsterdam. It is very much the kind of novel that will transport you lock, stock and flaming barrel to this part of the world. Delicious scenes of towns, schmoozing with the expat community and a central mystery about who is really chasing whom at the core. Explore the Mont&eacute;e de Clausen, and the Rue Sigefroi as Kate goes about her business, being the main carer of her children Jake and Ben, as she tries to make sense of who's who. The CIA, Interpol and FBI are all involved .... with secrets and more secrets... And who are Bill and Julia really?<br /><br />Enjoy the author's descriptions of central European hairstyles (which really are unique to locale) - \\""""mullets and bangs and spikes..\\"""" Enjoy langurous strolls.... Enjoy the dining experiences, the walks along cobbled streets, the trips across Europe.<br /><br />Overall, though, how much did we enjoy this novel? It's great for feeling you are part of the action and gaining a look in on the expat lifestyle; yet, on several levels it felt a little thin, for several reasons.<br />Firstly. It is very 'American' in its parlance. Ok, so that is our problem being non-American, but having to resort to a dictionary kind of breaks the rhythm of the read. For example: \\""""There were three locks and one of them looked like a doozy\\"""".Still not sure what a doozy is. Or, Bill and Julia's flat \\""""would allow such an ideal opportunity on assassinate-able characters\\"""". Assasinate-able?  Is that really a word and, er, I kind of get what the sentence means, I think?<br />Secondly. Up to the halfway mark the book flips back and forth between time frames and locales; with a paper book it is easier to check the sequence, and riffle back if you are unsure which era of reality you are currently in. With an e-book it is just that much harder - and therefore there may perhaps be a case that some novels are just not ideally suited to the e book format and, moreover, this format actually does them a disservice. (Your thoughts, dear reader?) Having said that the novel picks up pace in the second half and becomes more gripping as everything begins to unfold and take shape.<br />Thirdly. There are many reminders and revisits (in the manner of TV episodes that offer a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the preceding action \\""""Previously on.....\\""""): innumberable times we are told that Kate promised herself never to investigate her husband Dexter (and then, of course, does); or, that she now finds herself to be a mere housewife and how much that grates on her psyche - intimate details of her daily routine in and around the house, and her regrets about her former life are never far away... at times the reminders became so frequent that they verged on being truly irritating.<br />And Fourthly. There were quite a few inaccuracies, small, but nevertheless jarring, both in the e-book typesetting and the facts.12 hours from Luxembourg to Geneva, the book states, more like 6. \\""""The long drive to Holland\\"""" - that would be 3 hours then...<br /><br />So, if you are tempted to read this book, read it in book format, we think it will be a much more satisfying experience. Do pick it up if you are heading to central Europe, you will glean a lot about life there, as well as having a reasonable read.r to check the sequence, and riffle back if you are unsure which era of reality you are currently in.

"Great Characters, Average Procedural Great characters in an otherwise average CBS procedural. Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu give it all but not even they can elevate it to something more than the usual 'case of the week' type of a procedural that CBS pours out by the dozen. This show is more politically correct than others, featuring strong female characters, many characters of color and even transgender people played by transgender actors, but that's where the novelty ends. I admire that they stick with Sherlock and Joan as best friends, but overall, I expected something more, a more gripping drama.",0

"Dissapointing... I was eagerly anticipated this album - 5 years since the resplendent masterpiece, Riot On An Empty Street, and my expectations were sky high. But after three or four listens, it's lost me. Save for the typically resplendent vocals and guitar work, most of the album lacks the sumptuously delicate riffs that made their earlier songs so sweetly satisfying. It's a little hollow, basically.    'Boat Behind' is a standout track, but I expected more. And a little percussion or drums, too, which underpinned the wonderful stride of earlier cadenses. Still, I've no doubt that the Kings' next outing will be one that fulfils their extraordinary potential as two of the best songwriters in contemporary music today. Watch this space.",0

"Disgusting and shameless. Quite how this film was allowed to be produced and accepted into cinemas gives me great cause to never go again. I wanted to wait until the DVD release to re-watch this film just in case I had completely missed the plot or just been in a bad mood that night. I was toying with not bothering to waste my time writing a review on this film, but if I can dissuade one person from buying this DVD then that will make me feel better.     Imagine, if you will, the original, great, fantastic, Predator film, which broke barriers in cinema and was the first of its kind. Fast forward to 2010, some 23 years down the line, and they can't even produce a film to match it... Even though they used practically the entire story from the first (Adrien Brody covering himself in mud and flexing his far inferior body to Arnie, one of the characters waiting behind for a sword fight with the Predator, just like BIlly from the first.) It becomes amusing after the first half of the film and I found myself laughing away at the audacity of the director. Bringing in Lawrence Fishburne for such a ridiculous cameo was appalling.    The cross-referencing to the first film made me want to leave the cinema - mentioning that the story of Arnie and the original predator had been spread through the military with full details, even down to the fact that he covered himself in mud. If this was the case, then why on earth did no-one know about it in the second film or even the AvP films? Keyword for this review - LAUGHABLE. The plot holes are enormous.     The final insult for me was leaving the storyline open for a sequel. I would rather stick needles in my eyes than bother going to watch another one of these films - bring back a remastered version of the original (they managed in 1987 to make better special effects than this bodge job had to offer.) Shame that Adrien Brody wasted his time on this as well... He was just starting to become recognised as a decent actor with some entertaining roles. Unfortunate.",0

"Powerful! The use of a child to tell this story is powerful and effective. Even tho' I have read this novel many times, the exploits of Scout and Jem and their friend, Dill, are so engaging and play before my eyes. Many moments in this novel touch me. Their curiosity and innocence uncovered life in Maycomb, a town in Deep South America in the 1930s.There were the Cunninghams and their insistence, in spite of their poverty, to pay for help given to them by Scout's and Jem's father. There was Jem's defence of his father who was on the side of fairness and justice. There was the courtroom scene where people from different backgrounds recognised and respected decent human behaviour. There was Tom, a black American, who lost his fight for his innocence against the charges levied on him. I find it difficult to find fault in this novel. I suppose, if I was picky, it is that the words and therefore perceptions of Scout about what she witnessed and felt were not that of a child on many occasions but there could be artistic licence about this. I am always impressed about how the affection of Scout for her father shines through. Harper lee's novel remains one of my favourite books that I dip in and out.",1

"Definitely Not Their Best, Still Rather Enjoyable '...Like Clockwork' is the brand new album from Queens of the Stone Age. I sat down and listened to it just last night. Overall, it is a rather enjoyable listen, but it is definitely not their best, like it's being hyped up to be.<br /><br />Another problem for me is the exclusion of a booklet with lyrics and special guest contribution info. I'm not sure how the rest of you feel about this area, but for me, it would have been nice to have lyrics there while listening and it also would have been nice to know which guests contributed where etc.<br /><br />Also, as other reviewers have already mentioned, this album is by no means a return to the days of old for the band. Expect to find plenty of slow-tempo songs here, compared with the heavy/rock songs of old. For me, stand out tracks on the album are 'Keep Your Eyes Peeled', 'The Vampyre of Time and Memory', 'If I Had a Tail', 'Kalopsia', and the title track.<br />Staying with this for a second, some reviewers on here also have commented that the general sound of this album reminds them of Bowie in a lot of ways. Personally, I have to stress that I would agree strongly with that. The sound of '...Like Clockwork' does indeed have a kind of 'Bowie feel' to it; this is especially true in relation to Bowie's album, 'The Next Day', which was released earlier on this year.<br /><br />So, to sum up, '...Like Clockwork' is a rather enjoyable listen, but it is definitely not QOTSA's best effort and was not worthy of the hype it received, overall, in my opinion. Does that mean that '...Like Clockwork' is a bad album? No, it certainly does not. It is an album that does have its moments; it's just a little slower than what many fans will be used to, I feel. Lastly, just to say this, the album is by no means an arena filler (wink, wink; there's a tour coming up). However, despite the negatives, this is still a rather enjoyable listen.<br /><br />Just my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this. I hope it helps.",0
"Blu-Rays for the UK market are a rip off! OK, can someone please explain to me why Robocop turns up 3 - 6 months after the US version and is the CUT version with no extras???    Why on earth should I pay over £20 for the CUT 98 minute version of this film when the BBFC allows it to be released uncut?    The US version is the full 103 minute R rated version and was available for half the price, 3 - 6 months ago.    It makes me so mad that the UK is treated as some kind of Blu-Ray back water! Die Hard 4.0 the CUT version on Blu-Ray anyone?    Wake up and smell the roses. Something needs to happen here. I have long suffered the argument that HD-DVD is worse than Blu-Ray because it has less capacity. Well where exactly is that capacity going???    Discuss...",0

Four Stars To small :/,1
"Brilliant characters, insight into another world I read this book after reading Rounder's People, which I loved and I wanted another story with scotish characters.<br />This book is not so much a complete story but more like a series of stories that fit together because the characters are all connected. I found it quite difficult to read at first because ALL the words are in scotish spelling, not only the dialogue. But once I got used to it I started to really enjoy it. Begbie is a psychopath and very scary, even to his friends. Renton seemed like a normal guy who could have been in a successful career if he hadn't just happened to become a heroin addict.<br />I have to say that some of the scenes were pretty disgusting but I never felt it was unnecessary or over-the-top - sometimes they were even the funniest bits!<br />The writing and the characters felt very very real to me and I felt that the book gave me an insight into another world - hopefully one I won't ever experience for myself!!",1
"WOW I have watched the movie on TV, owned on VHS...and then became blown away when I purchased the Directors cut on DVD....thought it could not get better...<br /><br />GRAVELY MISTAKEN! This blu-ray version has all the cut scenes, remastered to blend in naturally, and is breath taking in all aspects!! A classic movie...now in HD!!",1
Five Stars Quality exactly what one whatt from a top band,1
"Not mind-blowing After having loved X&Y, I found Viva La Vida disappointingly disjointed.  There are some good tracks but on the whole the album just does not hang together.    The influence of Brian Eno is obvious from the start and this does have its benefits, but the real problem here is that the songs do not flow.  Instead they seem like a random collection - definitely ot a landmark album for the band.    I will still buy future Coldplay albums and look forward to a better effort next time.",0

Four Stars Pretty good..,1
BUY BUT BE AWARE. SO VERY DISAPPOINTED,0
"Some really bad advice in here. I was recommended this book by a friend but am not a fan.<br /><br />On the positive side there is a table that explains signs your baby makes and what get mean - these couple of pages were worth getting the book for as I was misreading a tired signal (turning head from side to side) as a hungry signal. Correcting my understanding of this has been very useful and this table alone earns the book 2 stars. I also agree with the books advice to carefully watch your baby for overstimulation.<br /><br />On the negative side I found this book smug and self promoting. More importantly I tried EASY and it caused us problems. After a month of tearing my hair out I have dropped EASY, my little one again sleeps through the night and is much happier again. The reason it doesn't work for us is my little one is a catnapper. Often 20-25 mins are all it takes to recharge her. Sometimes 45-60. She sleeps for whatever is required. Sometimes she'll nap 3 times in a day, sometimes 5. If I feed her straight after a nap she will take it but often doesn't need it and so has a smaller feed, and as she is breastfed she takes more foremilk and less hindmilk so it's not good for her. She dropped her centile on the weight chart and the increased lactose caused her to have tummy pain when I tried to follow easy. So EASY doesn't work for us. She needs to be fed much less frequently than she needs to be napped. I also disagree with dreamfeeding which this book says to do (lots on the internet with some advocates but personally it doesn't work for us).<br /><br />So buy if you want. But use it as a tool to listen to your baby. Don't necessarily follow her advice on what to do when you have worked out what your baby is telling you.",0
"Disappointing Formulaic Romance with no Substance This film has jack black, jude law and Kate Winslett in it, what could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />Simple answer;  EVERYTHING, it was patently manipulative - the aim of the film was to make you cry (which it didn't)  Predictable - Romance is OF COURSE about log fires, snowy cottages, charming old gentleman and sweet, yet somehow insightful children.<br /><br />Utter Tosh.  Watch Notting Hill, watch four weddings, while you were sleeping, give LA Story a go (kooky but good)leave this in the box.",0

Four Stars Present for a friend which she was very pleased with. Sounded great when played in the car.,1
"please give the record a listen to before you buy... another one of mike portnoy's bands that he put together flailing from being booted out of dream theater. first of all this sounds promising billy sheehan and mike portnoy! richie kotzen i'm not familiar with. Now before i explain why i gave this album 1 star i will preface it by saying that obviously all three of these guys are great musicians.<br /><br />Because they can play it's even more disappointing to here stock alt-rock riffs and these awful lyrics - for a band called the 'winery dogs' it's puzzling as to why their songs are all about sobriety and angels etc...<br /><br />and the vocals such a pale imitation of chris cornell, it's been done and you're also over 20 years late to cash in on this style<br /><br />I'm not sure who compared this to cream, I don't think cream ever wrote christian alt rock in the vein of \\""""I'm no angel\\"""" this sounds nothing like 60's blues rock at all<br /><br />please make sure you have a listen to this before buying because i really think the 130+ 5 star reviews are misleading and dishonest. Even if you like this record there is no way you could like that much.",0

"Rather read the book... I recently read P.S. I love you and was really looking forward to watch the movie, but sadly it did not live up to the book. I was also extremely disappointed that it took place in the USA and not Ireland, because I was looking forward to some of the memorable scenes for example the lilo scene in the book. It was sad that Daniel was portrayed to be so rude and that the lead actress's two brothers weren't written into the movie.    I would rather suggest the book or the movie. Do not do both.",0

'Fat Old Sun' is a fairly good song, but the rest? Give me a break. The title track isn't even good enough to be considered a mess, 'If' is boring, 'Summer '68' is rubbish, and just what the **** is 'Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast' about?  <br /> <br />Avoid this rubbish.

"Inglorious Movie I loved Tarrantino's brilliant Pulp Fiction and Resevoir Dogs,and the great Kill Bill. Death Proof was rubbish and Tarrantino yet again proves to us that he cannot write a screenplay by himself. He really needs the help of Roger Avary who co-wrote his earlier movies.<br /><br />Inglourious Bas starts off brilliantly, and after the first twenty minutes it desends into a complete dialogue driven snoozefest. The famous action sequence in the Bar cellar consists of twenty five minutes of boring banter and ten seconds of an epic shoot out.<br /><br />The famous bar/ cellar scene is a major anti climax. Tarantino is trying to reproduce the shock value of the car crash climax half way through Deathproof. Except that he had really dull characters talk for too damn long before the inevitable flurry of violence occured. By which point the violence was just relief fromt he tedium of the film as it was - rather than a surprise or a climax...<br /><br />Inglorious Basterdds fails miserably, and I don't care how clever critics think Tarrantino was mashing Euro art film with action/Western/war movie.<br /><br />Most are just too scared to suggest the \\""""genius\\"""" Tarrantino \\""""enfant terrible\\"""" of delivering another crap movie and expecting Joe Public to pay to see it. Kill Bill was very good. Res Dogs and Pulp Fiction were great. Death Proof and Inglor Bast are rubbish movies.",0

When this book came into my possession, I was so excited after having had so much fun reading the Pillars from the Earth, but after the first 100 pages I started to feel that something was wrong, the characters lacked absolutely evrything in terms of depth and development.<br />The book is so extremely boring and slow paced that it really hurts to figure out that this is the same man who wrote the first book aforementioned.<br />Anyway, dissapointing is a mild word to describe this book and which makes me wonder if he was really the man who wrote it.",0

"For completists only. Reattributing recording sessions - when a sideman becomes more famous than the leaders under which he previously recorded, sometimes the latters' sessions are re-issued under the former's name - is rather common in jazz, but John Coltrane seems to be the musician to which this happens the most, largely because he A) has become so famous and B) recorded a lot in 1957-58.<br /><br />All the recordings on this set date from this period, and although Coltrane plays throughout half of them aren't Coltrane albums; on many of them he was just a sideman or at best co-leader: the proper leaders for half the albums here being Kenny Burrell (...& John Coltrane), Johhny Griffin (A Blownin' Session), Red Garland (All Mornin' Long) and Elmo Hope (Informal Jazz). This doesn't make the music bad by any means (with the possible exception of Hope, these are all well-known and well-thought of jazz musicians), and some of these albums might actually be unavailable outside this set - but it's a real stretch to call these Coltrane Albums, and rather unfair and insulting to the musicians whose brainchild these sessions really were to attribute them to Coltrane for marketing purposes (for better or worse, the Coltrane name sells better than Red Garland!).<br /><br />The other half of the albums here are Coltrane-led, but, with the exception of Traneing In, consist of miscellaneous sessions collected and released by Prestige after Coltrane left (in 1958) and released without his input or approval. \\""""The Last Trane\\"""" is a particularly egrerious example of this, being a compilation of three unrelated recording sessions. Traneing In is the only \\""""proper\\"""" Coltrane album here, the only one which Coltrane himself designed and approved.<br /><br />Of course, neither this nor the fact that Coltrane wasn't even leader on half these sessions doesn't invalidate the music on these sessions. It's just that this are not important sessions in the Coltrane story, like Giant Steps, Africa/Brass, A Love Supremeetc... There's lots of good stuff here, but this set can hardly be considered an \\""""essential\\"""" Coltrane collection: what it actually is is a collection of early and formative sideman work, fascinating and useful in its way, but of more interest to completists than to casual listeners or those approaching Coltrane for the first time. Perfectly good on its own terms, but there are higher-priority purchases. The Vol. 2 set from the same people contains far more of Coltrane's own, significant releases.",0

"Better than the 1st..... Much better than the last one in terms of plot - an overbearing ex, another ex who poses a deadly threat and a harassing boss make for a better story this time. However, all the sex scenes are rather repetitive and one wonders what the author's own love life must be like if this is all her imagination yields...<br /><br />Unsurprisingly though it is still horrendously written in a way that makes me want to slap the author round the face with a thesaurus before she can so much as bite her lip or turn to her inner goddess for advice.. Ok for a beach read, but I'm so glad I didn't put any money into Ms. James' coffers for these - bought all three from the charity shop down the road which will be getting them back shortly.",0

"Very Good album but not one of his best When I heard about this album, I was excited. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds rarely do a bad album and we've been following him and his 2 bands Bad Seeds and Grinderman for a while, through quite a few albums and a couple of live gigs. So far he hasn't put a foot wrong.<br /><br />I have to say we were both disappointed in this album. There are a couple of stand alone tracks, such as Higgs Boson Blues and Jubillee Street but the rest of the album feels as if its waiting for something better. There are no truly biting and angry songs with rage and energy, like with the Lyre of Orpheus and Abbatoir Blues and there are no wild tracks like Babe, I'm on Fire. Its underwhelming to say the least.<br /><br />This album feels more in tune with Nocturama but with less emotion. Cave and his crew have delivered some superb material in the past and i'm looking forward to more of the brilliant stuff which made me laugh and cry in equal measure.",0

"Mixed feelings As an admirer of Mark Knopflers's playing skills and songwriting, I quite enjoy this album, but feel that the songs themselves lack the strength in depth of some of his solo work, and that there is no single stand-out track to showcase the considerable talents of those involved.  Maybe it will continue to grow.",0

"99 minutes of pure hell. A misshapen muntant movie. I adored the first two x men films. What could have possibly made this film so bad as it is? Well there probably won't be enough room in this review for me to write down all the things that I hate about this film, so I'll just type down the main points. The film's script. The first two films have some very important messages being sent to us about discrimination. This film shows no message at all to the audience apart from the fact that the reason you're watching this film in the first place is because you're probably drunk. The characters in the film. There are many new Mutant \\""""heroes\\"""" in the movie, including angel and beast. But the director is also removing characters such as Nightcrawler, Cyclops and shockingly professor Xavier. Before the film came out, the cast said that these new characters are going to make x men 3 into the best x men of all. Angel, a very interesting character is made into a joke. I counted how many sentences he said in the film, 4. He was only in two scenes which was not involved with the x men at all. What's even more laughable is beast. If you've read the comics as I have, you'd realise his romance for Storm and how he is hated by the public. In x men 3 however he works for the embassy (what?). Sure, the action and the special effects are well made but there is no way I found them entertaining. If only Brian Singer could have returned for this and saved 99 minutes of my life, but he was busy filming superman. I know it is very similar to the pheonix saga in the x men comics, but i didn't even enjoy them. At the end of the film I started laughing hystericly in the middle of the cinema. People were staring at me as if I was a complete lunatic. But I wasn't. I was only laughing at how dumb, pointless and truly absymal x men 3 was. I only wish I was drunk to have watched this movie but I wasn't. X men 3 is probably the largest dissapointment of my life.<br /><br />My advice, don't bother.",0

"Another masterpiece slaughtered by the """"loudness war"""" All Iron Maiden albums from \\""""The Number Of The Beast\\"""" to \\""""Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\"""" are absolute classics and timeless masterpieces. I grew up listening to these records, and I know every lyric, every pause, every guitar tone and every tempo change by heart. So, more than sad, I'm really angry to have to say that all the \\""""enhanced\\"""" 1998 releases are complete sonic disasters, \\""""loudness war\\"""" productions with the audio dynamic range slaughtered by whoever was responsible for doing the remastering. It seems that the idea was to turn all the way up the sound of every single instrument and vocal line with no regard to the equilibrium between them within the music's context. I almost cried in anger when I heard those guitar chords at the start of the song \\""""Moonchild\\"""", with the originally carefully distorted tone turned into a mass of just plain annoying, pointless distortion, and all the feeling lost.<br /><br />Every time I get to write about a dear album destroyed by a \\""""loudness war\\"""" remaster, I ask people to go to a search engine like Google and look up the expression (between quotes for an exact match). There are over 47,000 results for it on Google alone. The \\""""loudness war\\"""" refers to a trend which started in the late nineties in the music industry to record CD's at increasingly higher volume levels, in an attempt to lure buyers into believing that they were getting a better product because it's a \\""""remaster\\"""" and it sounds louder. What happens most of the time is the exact opposite - masterpieces like this album are sonically cannibalized, and often (although not the case here) the audio volume is pushed beyond the limits of the CD format's specitications, which causes parts of the sound to get \\""""clipped\\"""" (cut off, lost) because they don't \\""""fit\\"""" within the available range. I specially recommend that people at least read an online article called \\""""The Death Of Dynamic Range\\"""" and watch to a very popular video available on YouTube called \\""""The Loudness War\\"""", both of which explain in an easily understandable way what this thing is all about. Things have reached such an extreme point that you can find people on P2P networks sharing lossless files with digitized versions of the original vinyl recordings of entire discographies of seminal bands like Iron Maiden because the CD's currently available are just unbearable to listen to.<br /><br />As always, it's hard to tell if the band had any say in these releases, but anyway, they are an unacceptable insult to the band's musical legacy and their fans. If you want to hear Iron Maiden closer to how the original records used to sound, look for the first \\""""non-remastered-nor-enhanced\\"""" CD releases of their albums.in an easily understandable way what this thing is all about.

Not for Christians If you are not a Christian please disregard this review.  I bought this book after seeing it recommended on a Christian homeschooling blog.

It does not glorify God as creator.,0

"Could Have Been Better Prince Rogers Nelson is a creative genius, no one can deny, but this album does not meet my expectations. I am a die hard Prince fan and after hearing Gold and The Most Beautiful Girl In The World, I thought the album would be ace. In my opinion this album does not live up to his exacting high standards. I usually have to listen to one of his albums several times before I accept it as an excellent work of art, but even listening to this album a few times I still do not like it that much apart from the songs I have mentioned.",0

"watchable This has to be the worst of the three adaptations made for the ITV jane austen season. dont get me wrong - the actors were great choices, especially Michelle Ryan as Mariah. I loved the costumes as well, there was obviously a lot of money invested in them and the scenery of Mansfield Park was just how i pictured it when i read the book.    BUT... where was MR Yates and Fanny's sister? Fanny herself does not return to Portsmouth either. I think the slight of Mr Rushworth at his own estate when he shows the party around his gardens would have added to the development and impropriety of  Henry and Mariah's conduct. Miss Crawford was less severe than the one i read in Jane austens book.    saying that, i have watched it on a number of occassions but beware those who are looking for a faithful adaptation",0

"A surprising publishing success; a very technical SF novel gone mainstream! The plot is straightforward; Mark Watney is stranded on Mars, left for dead when his mission goes wrong and the rest of the crew leave before a devastating sand storm hits. The book details his fight for survival by maintaing the life support systems, oxygenator, water purifier/reclaimer etc. within the habitation chamber left behind, whilst growing potatoes.... lots of potatoes. NASA realise from satellite images and set out to rescue him.<br /><br />I understand the novel was originally self-published, before being picked up by a publisher, and it has a raw unedited feel to it. It is a good survival story, but extremely technical in parts with lots of calculations about oxygen concentrations, water usage, atomspheric composition etc.<br />It does have a credible feel to it, but due to the subject and technical nature of it I'm suprised it has been such a mainstream success because it is basically a very technical SF novel, not really a formula for a best seller.<br />It is largely written as a journal that Watney writes, interspersed with Earth based sequences where NASA plan to rescue him. Although cleverly put together from the technical perspective, the writing is rather basic, and as others have pointed out rather lacking in depth, which is a pity because more attention here would really have lifted the novel. Some good ideas, but this is a shining example of how a story in the hands of a more gifted writer could have been much better. Three and a half stars.",0

"Hurley ruined the listen I enjoyed the audiobook, that is until Joe Hurley took over for Deep. Deep's read was so simple, almost monotone, but I really came to enjoy it, as it let me simply hear Keith's words as just that, Keith's words. Hurley works so hard at being Richards, acting the role that I found him in the way. His cockney, his laughter, I just wanted to scream, \\""""Stop it!\\"""" It was as though he was attempting to be Richards in a one-man show. He seemed to be interpreting Richards' intention to such a degree, so we hear sarcasm and bitterness which might not really be K.R.'s intent. I decided to stop listening and actually pick up the book itself. Probably all for the best.",0

"A story of Identity and Belonging I found myself fully immersed in this book from the start and read it in 2 days Although the ending was clear from page 2, the journey toward this end was interesting and well put togther. The main themes of identity and belonging are played out against a well constructed background, so well described you felt you were there - a hairdressers will never be the same again!<br />I particulaly liked the way the author transposes life in Nigeria, England and America and the way it examines what it means to be black in America and then what it is to return to Africa as a naturalised American black woman and to live as an illegal immigrant in England. At times, though, I did feel that there were loose ends that I would have liked to follow, for instance what happens to Dike? For him the experience of being black in America is traumatic - how did it end? Is there hope for those who cannot find their place in this world?<br />This is a book that can be read again and again and on many levels. I admit that in this first reading I did not focus too much on the long sections reproduced from blog posts - next reading will be in much more detail. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a fine writer who writes with passion and care. Read this book!",1

"Lost the plot?! Lost in Translation is an odd movie and after seeing it, I didn't think much of it. The plot is childish and to be honest, not all that interesting no matter how many people try to find 'deeper meanings' - two depressed and inherently unlikable characters (who they are really would make no difference to the film) meet in Tokyo, mutually moan, complain and share their depression, and subsequently lighten up for a few days. Ah, you might say, it's that 'lightening up' moment that conveys the never-say-die nature of the human spirit, encapsulates the point of the film, demonstrates the need for companionship. No, actually, what it conveys is that people, even depressed ones, can meet up and go on the beer and the alcohol numbs their pain if only for a day. And that, in a nutshell, is it. Technically the film is poor, the depression of the characters being conveyed by boring the audience with lots of minutes of nothing happening (when I saw this in the cinema I nipped out to go to the toilet, then went and bought some popcorn and I didn't miss a single beat). Some might argue that this is to create in the audience an understanding of the characters, but Mystic River and 28 Grams dealt with depressed characters and yet managed to make it an interesting study of human nature. In terms of acting, if shuffling around with a glum look, sighing a lot, mumbling and looking weary is supposed to convey 'this character is depressed' then Bill Murray is excellent. But in fairness that's not really acting, it's cliche. Scarlett Johansson is clearly in the movie beause she pouts and frowns a lot, and because she has great legs. But even they aren't worth seeing this film for. I know many people think Lost in Translation is excellent so you may like it, you may not, but my advice is rent it before you buy it. And get lots of coffee in too .... and not that decaff rubbish either.",0

"Only The First Step I am glad that this book is helping people understand the power of their thoughts. But in my experience there is much more to the manifestation process than what is described in this book. I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and The Secret never really addresses the concept of a \\""""higher power\\"""" that may be leading you to a \\""""higher good,\\"""" that is, to something that is even BETTER than what you imagined possible, and something that is always the BEST FOR ALL. Also, The Secret rarely mentions the importance of taking action. It makes it sound like all you have to do is visualize what you want and it will \\""""come to you.\\"""" I have found that what \\""""comes to me\\"""" are the people and events that LEAD me to what I want, and if I am not paying attention, I may miss the action step that I am being guided to take. There is another book that makes these points, and more. It is called, [[ASIN:0974459739 Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow]] I think it's a great companion to The Secret.",0

"On Chesil Beach I may as well start this review stating I was disappointed with the book, I still gave it three stars but I expect more from McEwan. The prose is clean and moves forward at a good walking pace (not a fast paced page turner... not that I was expecting that). The writing is a little dull and I could have hoped for a little more painterly in the style. The characters were created well and felt real, but putting them on the brink of the 60's and showing their pre sexual revolution hang ups seemed a little heavy handed. I realise it was about the class barrier between the two lead characters, Edward and Florence, with Edward being lower middle class who gets electric guitar driven music and Florence who is upper middle class and doesn't get rock n roll so much that McEwan even made her a classical musician... Really, we can understand that someone might not like rock n roll from that time era; does she really have to epitomise the old guard? The plot which I have failed to even mention (because I suck at writing reviews) is the lead up to the first time the two married virgins have sex. It flashes back to their courting and has scenes after too. The exchange they have at the end of the book (trying not to ruin it for you) is fantastic, their actions perfect as well as the dialogue. If only the book would have ended there at that marvelous natural ending, it could have been an ambiguous beauty. Instead of this McEwan carries on summing up the rest of the life of a character, which in this humble reviewer's opinion diminished the previously mentioned exchange.",0

Basically it was a tweaking of a programme I already follow, the Body for life programme as recommended by my gym instructor and find that most satisfying. I came to this hoping it would offer some groundbreaing something I missed, instead it is full of wacko ideas I have no intention of using unfortunately.<br /><br />Save your cash and get this stuff better and for free from the internet.",0

"HOPE FOR THE HOPELESS As a writer of academic books I wondered how I would get on with Mark Haddon's unusual style, but the more I read, the more it grew on me because the style is a reflection of the personality of Christopher, the central character who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. The seemingly disjointedness of the narrative is an accurate reflection of Christopher's fragmented mind. As a health care professional of many years I found the book enlightening and instructive. At times I found myself chuckling and at other times near to tears. This is not a book for the fainthearted but I think every healthcare professional should read it, for even if they might never be involved with anyone with Asperger's, the insights gained go far beyond this one condition and give an insight into the minds of people suffering from mental illness.",0

"Disapointed1 I can't understand why so many people have rated this game highly. It is so boring just going from room to room to find yet again another hidden object continually having to tap tap tap. When you do rarely get an actual puzzle to solve, which isn't often, they are so easy. The game is also so boringly slow that it is easy to double tap or even triple tap before anything happens and end up moving several scenes instead of one. This I would say is an old game and there are far better ones out now with better graphics and puzzles and response times. Hope to find a better game soon.",0

"Somewhat disappointed Initally I found this book extremely interesting especially as I had no previous knowledge of HeLa or their massive contribution to the scientific world. However, I felt that this could have been told in a more concise and informative way and once the initial impact had passed I found the rest of the book somewhat of a struggle.  I found it difficult to completely sympathise with the fortunes of the LACKS family any more than any other black American family subject of social deprivations at that time and became frustrated and confused as to what exactly they wanted. Money? Recognition? Apologies? Information? All of the afore?  It seemed to me that the fortunes of the family merely padded out the real story which was HeLa itself and that there were many other social and personal factors that contributed to the families misfortunes and inability to come to terms with what had happened.  To me the real issues here were prejudice and social ignorance of the times. In todays society the LACKS would have been sought out by an American Max CLIFFORD and then everyone would be happy!!!",0

"After the initial magic wears away, it isn't much more than curious neo-psychedilia complete with generous Fridmann production. The third and eponymous album by MGMT is not the album you, as a presumed fan of their work up to now, have been expecting in many ways. Although their new and unique \\""""electro-psychedelic\\"""" direction is admirable and at least interesting for the most part, this does not mean a really fantastic album and in this case, MGMT seem to have missed a trick. Disregarding the acclaim that they felt they didn't deserve for their debut, \\""""Oracular Spectacular\\"""", they continued to create \\""""Congratulations\\"""" which the band now concedes to not have been a great effort. Adamant to show what the band is really about, \\""""MGMT\\"""" rushes straight down the more unconventional path and ends up in a place full of half-baked ideas along with some better ones.<br /><br />The album's ten tracks, none of which run over six minutes, offer two distinct flavours generally split into Side 1 and Side 2. Side 1 hosts the tracks with the stronger melodies and hooks while Side 2 deals with the more \\""""trippy\\"""" cuts which include both the weakest and strongest material MGMT have ever crafted. To say that \\""""MGMT\\"""" is a disaster is an over-exaggeration to say the least. It shows that the band is still interested in trying to make new and engaging music which is reassuring as it is the most valuable asset in this band. The duo are not prolific by any stretch of the imagination so it is slightly disappointing that the time spent on most of the songs seem to have been on making the production sound brilliant (which it does) instead of writing compelling melodies that evolve over the course of its run time.<br /><br />There are exceptions to this criticism however. These include the relatively conventional, spacey opener \\""""Alien Days\\"""", the following piano based \\""""Cool Song No. 2\\"""" and the overwhelmingly colourfully produced \\""""A Good Sadness\\"""". These tracks prove that if they had devoted more time to the songwriting, in whatever way they do it, then they would have an album filled with brilliantly unique and attention-grabbing music. As it stands, the majority of the songs seem to have been derived from aimless elongated jam sessions by picking the best fruit out of a bad bunch and it shows in the weaker tracks (see the watery, wrinkly orange segment that is \\""""Astro-Mancy\\""""). Although there are several moments of inspired psychedelic goodness in these \\""""experimental\\"""" sections, \\""""I Love You Too Death\\"""" being a definite highlight of Side 2 with its dreamily textured atmosphere punctuated by a yawning bass sound, the main bulk of the album is full of above average sounding synth effects, guitar parts and drum tracks.<br /><br />Therefore, the real question is what they get up to next. There is no doubt that the band is getting better in many ways; the lyrics are a real step up from previous efforts (VanWyngarden has become very accomplished with whimsical, lulluby poetry which fits nicely to the music) and the production, as mentioned before, is consistently vibrant throughout the album. However, the duo's reliance to trust their first instinct and pass it off as the best they can do is to do a disservice to them; they are two outstandingly imaginative musical minds if they bother to concentrate.<br /><br />So although this may not be the remarkable breakthrough that some expected from this self-titled offering, it is positive sign that the band is definitely going places; \\""""MGMT\\"""" just happens to be a stepping stone that takes them further out than ever while also bringing them closer to true magnificence.",0

"Bloated, Dull and Self-indulgent First of all, I am not a Tarantino-hater: I liked his debut Reservoir Dogs, partly enjoyed his blackly-comedic Pulp Fiction and loved the brilliant Jackie Brown. I consider those first three films to be his most provocative and compelling; they demonstrated that he could offer something fresh while at the same time, &#34;homaging&#34; old genres and classics (most notably Film Noir plot-lines). However ever since those three film I believe he has not made good one. Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 were awful as they had one-dimensional characters and large scenes of rampant self-indulgent dialogue (I like comic books etc.) and was also point blank plagiarism of old Shaw Brothers and Samurai films but without any elements of originality. The same applied to the terrible Vanishing Point (1971) meets Psycho (1960) rip-off: Death Proof and Inglorious Basterds was an extremely over-long rip-off of Robert Aldrich's excellent war film, The Dirty Dozen (1967). However I had high-expectations for &#34;Django Unchained&#34; after reading constantly five star reviews from prestigious newspapers and magazines, I thought this was a return to form and the plot looked very interesting in the way it moulded the compelling genres of &#34;Spaghetti Westerns&#34; and &#34;Blaxploitation.&#34;<br /><br />I'll start with what I liked about the film, first of all I liked the use of colour which was extra-heightened and gave the whole film an eye-pleasing, &#34;comic-book panache&#34;, I also appreciated the film's riveting premise, &#34;a freed slave plans revenge on the Slave-owner who owns his wife&#34; , also Leonardo Dicaprio is suitably vicious in his role as the pantomime villain of the film, Candy, Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant as the servile servant, Stephen, he is easily the best thing about this film and finally I liked how the film was going to pay homage to Spaghetti Westerns which is a very entertaining genre.<br /><br />Unfortunately there were many more poor aspects to the film than good. It seemed like Tarantino was going to create something fresh out of exploitation cinema, however, the film was a terrible disappointment. First of all, even though I liked the long dialogue scenes in Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs; the endless dialogue in Django was unnecessary, it went on and on in an incredibly monotonous manner without saying anything intelligent or substantial. In one scene Django and Schultz talk in pub forever, in another scene while the two principals characters and the villain of the piece talk around a table: Tarantino makes, Candy, speak for at least twenty minutes about various subjects while at the same time building to a climax, however the climax that it build to diffuses quickly and builds to a final anti-climax.<br /><br />Tarantino's use of dialogue is sometimes good, yet here he just does not know when to stop, a good screenwriter knows a scene can only hold the interest of the audience for so long before making them exasperated; a good screenwriter knows this such as Andrew Dominik who directed and wrote the brilliant crime thriller, &#34;Killing Them Softly&#34; he employs the same method as Tarantino: using dialogue to drive scenes yet he knows never to let the dialogue scenes pointlessly continue; and packs it all within 1hr 30 min runtime. If the long scenes of dialogue in Django were clever, witty and effective (which they are in Reservoir Dogs) than I wouldn't have a problem with it, yet they're not, they have the effect of a writer constantly writing with the objective of filling up an entire scene.<br /><br />Tarantino is so powerful now that no producer has the guts to tell him his scenes are way too pointlessly long, therefore he feels he can make scenes go on and on. Any serious film editor can clearly see that this film is sorely in need of cutting: watching Django is like watching a film that hasn't reached the editing stage of film production. The length is completely unwarranted, it is not intelligent film, its exploitation entertainment (which isn't a bad thing) and does not have anything meaningful to say therefore it does not need the runtime of an epic and intelligent film (of nearly 3hrs) as it does not merit that length. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a near 3hr film that merits its entire epic narrative which encompasses an epic odyssey that includes bandits, violence, betrayal, revenge, the american civil war and three vastly different and interesting characters competing for confederate gold. That film merits its runtime starting in the American West and ending in large cemetery, Django Unchained just goes from freeing a slave in the West to a plantation, with pretty much nothing major or significant happening in between.<br /><br /> It has nothing say about Slavery no matter how much Tarantino likes to claim it does: Slavery acts as a backdrop to the revenge story yet nothing meaningful or informative is said about it (except for the obvious and crude elements: slavery is evil, white plantation owners are evil, slaves were whipped violently, they were also abused etc.) which are elements that are obvious and well-known. Django is a homage to exploitation Westerns and those rarely ran longer than and 1hr and 30mins which would have been perfect for Django whose plot is so wafer-thin that it just cannot sustain the bulky and flabby 2hrs 45mins. Tarantino thinks that if a film is long he is making something epic and profound yet the film does not have enough plot for the endless runtime, Tarantino knows this and therefore drags scenes on with just people talking: in Tarantino's case more is less. Tarantino's film is homaging Westerns and Revenge Cinema and therefore does not need a massive runtime, I could see this film would have been perfect with runtime of 1hr 40mins and would not have damaged at all the quality of film; in fact the film would have been much more superior, compelling and punchy if he had cut the excessive flab (which the film has masses of) and delivered just the meat.<br /><br />In Spaghetti Westerns the violence was entertaining and riveting, like a Fistful of Dollars in which Clint Eastwood's character guns down a group of bandits and the original Django in which Franco Nero's hero faces off, with a machine gun, a massive group of Klu Klux Klan coming for him. However Tarantino's use of violence emits no excitement: I am not squeamish when it comes to violence yet I do not find the violence in Tarantino's film to be entertaining at all even it he wants us to, no matter how much he thinks gory violence is fun. Most of violent set-pieces feature a man getting ripped apart by a dog, a man killed by a hammer, a gory fight between two Mandingo fighters; it is Tarantino's love for torture-like violence that destroys the entertainment of the film with the exception of only one scene in a hilariously over-the top shootout near the end which actually delivers the violence we want in a Western. He is trying to homage Spaghetti Westerns, whose films had operatic and exciting shootouts yet Tarantino ditches this form of entertaining violence for his preferred which is basically very bloody scenes that border on horror porn. Defenders would argue that the violence in the film is not meant to funny or entertaining as Tarantino is attempting to present violence as it is: brutal and shocking. However this would be a lie as Tarantino has stated he &#34;relishes violence&#34; and many of the violent scenes of Django Unchained seem purposely made to emit laughs from bloody situations.<br /><br />Finally the main character was also a weak factor for me; he seemed incredibly one-dimensional and motiveless. Django is a character utterly empty of any type of charisma or personality: he lacks any vicious or angry intensity for revenge that a revenge-obsessed character would possess. It seems like he is completely indifferent to the idea of exacting revenge on Candy. Django's desire for revenge is handled with a complete lack of energy, intensity or momentum: for a guy whose wife has been stolen and humiliated by a nasty plantation owner Django doesn't seem to express any anger or hatred about it but only a kind of cold indifference which makes him a very dull character. For a main character he is outshone by his mentor Shultz who at least shows some type of character development: he is forced to confront a dilemma during the film between the bounty hunter business he operates in and the slave trade and at least he confronts a problem and undergoes an emotional upheaval. Whilst all that can be said for Django is he remains in coma-like state throughout the film no matter whether he is angry, upset, cool or happy. In the end when the &#34;great revenge&#34; finally happens that Django is supposed to exact on Candy and which the film has been built up to, it is incredibly underwhelming and anti-climactic (a totally miscalculated scene on the part of Tarantino). The film left me unmoved and un-invested in the dull, under-developed main character and his anti-climactic and unexciting quest for revenge which, believe or not, I actually wanted to be interested in.<br /><br />I know for many, Tarantino's Western film is great, yet I found his film to fail on so many levels: the violence, the plot, the main character the length and his over reliance on dialogue. I was expecting a compelling homage to classic Spaghetti Westerns with action and a compelling revenge plot instead I got film in which it characters talk forever and whose dialogue derail and slow down an otherwise interesting premise.Westerns the violence was entertaining and riveting, like a Fistful of Dollars in which Clint Eastwood's character guns down a group of bandits and the original Django in which Franco Nero's hero faces off, with a machine gun, a massive group of Klu Klux Klan coming for him.

"Flawless, Pt 2 Arguably the better of the two Juggernaut releases, but only by a small margin (as both are excellent), Omega offers perhaps the widest variety of styles, ranging from the the largely clean Priestess to the ultra-proggy djent-fest title track, to the sludgy dropped-tuning tones of Hell Below. Although this album has fewer tracks than Alpha, Omega more than makes up for this in sheer songwriting mastery.<br />As with Alpha, it is important to remember that the two parts are a concept album, and as such should not be listened to expecting dis-sociable singles. Omega is slightly better for this, as it doesn't contain anything akin to Four Lights/The Event (from Alpha), but passages of Omega can be thought 'tacked-on' if not taken in the context of the concept album it's a part of.<br />Strongest moments for me were definitely Stranger Things (a perfect finish to the album), the refreshing change in Priestess, and The Bad Thing for its pure riffery (*pun*). Weakest moment is Reprise, simply because the rest of the album is so well crafted and this song simply bridges Alpha and Omega.",1

"Painful Imagine the conversations Bella can have with, uh, 'Nessie' when she is older.     \\""""Your life partner? Yeah, he and I nearly married. He pictured me as the mother of his children. Small world, huh?'    Personally I'm not comfortable with the idea of imprinting on children - implications aside, Nessie could, after all, could grow into anyone, including someone Jacob may not love - but the idea of imprinting on the child of the woman you loved is just wrong. It also destroys all the idea of the love triangle, Bella's choices between normal/comfortable love and life and true love that requires giving up so much. Bella doesn't have to give up anything and Jacob, who Meyer states Bella 'fell in love' with, becomes her son in law.     Moral issues aside, the book is also simply not well written. Admittedly this was never Meyer's strong point, but her writing has really degenerated in this book. Twilight was good for its real-life feel, its likeable characters and romantic fancy. Breaking Dawn destroys any ability to empathise with Bella, whose situation becomes ridiculous and overly perfect; even her flaws are erased as she becomes the ultimate Mary Sue fantasy.     Meyer's obsession with fertility was tiresome also. Leah's situation was poorly handled and 18-year-old Bella who, we are led to believe, is intelligent enough to go to a good college, is palmed off being a teenage mother. There are ways to stop sperm, even magic all-pervading vampire spawn that, if I remember the first few books aright, shouldn't even be able to be produced. Even the consistancy of Meyer's own vampire mythology was ignored (no physical fluids except venom) in order for Bella to have her 'happy', female ending. I'm not even touching the Alien-esque birthing.    Even the romance in the story is nearly non-existant. There were few genuinely quality romantic moments between Edward and Bella that weren't purely physical - their emotional intimacy was totally neglected.    Not a good conclusion toa story with potential and promise.",0

"Not a film I'll remember 20 years down the road Before I saw this film I read a review claiming it could be the best film of the decade and so on and so forth. And there were plenty of good reviews to back that up. So before I saw the film I had visions of this being up there with Toy Story, The Incredibles and Wall E. To say that the film was a letdown would be accurate. Now don't get me wrong, the Pixar animation was incredible but the story line was not well managed at all. Here are my complaints:    1. Even though the main character's wife could be considered the main female role in the film, she really only existed in pictures and so not having a strong active female role in the film left a huge gap in the film in my opinion.     2. Even though the old man's grumpiness in tandem with the hyper child would normally create a sort of humour, I just didn't feel it. I don't know if it was because they didn't pick great actors to voice the parts or if the dialogue was dumbed down.     3. My third complaint is the time allocated to certain parts of the film. It seems like there was too much time devoted to the history of the relationship between the man and the woman and I think it took a lot of the air out of the film. Yes, it was good to see a brief history of the old man with a bit of emotion thrown in but it went on and on and on which took all the energy out the film and forced the film into a kind of aimless wallow. And then to top it off it took another good portion of the film before the house actually took off and started the adventure.     4. There was no part of the film devoted to the preparation of the journey, it was just a quick happening.     5. Then to top it off the old man still seemed to resent the journey and I don't think he ever seemed to revel in it for any period of time.     6. The adventure only seemed to last about 20 minutes or so.     7. The talking dogs in the film seemed to be too original of a concept and almost too different to grasp the concept of it in such a short period of time. And I don't understand the purpose of them in relation to the overall film. It's kind of like trying to introduce a whole new direction to the film in the last 20 minutes.",0

"A masterpiece of modern movie making Second time I've watched this [after delivery], and enjoyed it more than the first.<br />The original Tron was brill in its day but this is awesome! I'm sure everybody's main highlight will be the light cycle battle, and then the light jet chase, later on in the film. There is plenty of less intense action here and there.<br />It may seem far fetched to people who lack imagination, but that's their loss.<br />What a fantasy with brilliant graphics, yet to be matched.",1
Four Stars son loves this film,1
"One of the all time great albums. One of the best albums ever made , anyone with even a scintilla of interest In English folk music should own  this superb collection of songs. A truly masterful work which, at the price it is now available for, probably cheaper than in its week of release more than 40 years ago, is a complete steal",1
"Utter Tosh In my opinion, the lead &#34;actor&#34; got his fee under false pretences - he may have turned up when required, and whisper-recited his lines - such as they were - but he's possessed of only 1.5 facial expressions and a double zero squared for screen presence.  He's an empty shirt taking the place of an actor, lord knows what halfwit cast him in this role.<br />John Hurt looked bored from start to finish - and who could blame him. Perhaps offers are drying up for his sort of part? If I had paid hard cash for this tosh I'd have been upset, but as it is I wasted a perfectly good couple of hours when I could have been watching paint dry and being more entertained as a result.<br />The script is lame beyond belief, much in line with the &#34;actor&#34; in the leading role's drama skills.  One wonders how the spacemen managed to kill off these Moorhen things originally, such was the invulnerability displayed by this final example in Norse Iron Age Scandinavia.  The plot is a mix of all sorts of things but most elements are lifted directly from Beowulf - presumably because the story in the poem is slightly out of copyright dating as it does from early/middle English days.<br />It was said earlier that this didn't make it to cinema release? If it had done, it would be very easy to imagine the audiences walking out after maybe half an hour to go do something entertaining instead.",0

"enticing but lacking This book starts beautifully. It is truly captivating with magical themes, curious characters and romance along with danger and much intrigue. I was hooked right to the end, not wanting to put the book down.It is rare to come across such an original story and such a beautiful way of telling it.<br />However,once I had finished the book I found it somewhat lacking. The story builds and builds for a great finale but it seems as though the writer almost rushed to complete the book without creating a suburb ending or leaving the reader with any long lasting impression of the story.<br />I am glad I read this story as I did enjoy it but I just felt that it was missing something and needed a little more finesse and a little less 'wishy washy' explanation for its events.",0

"Mel Brooks did it better If I'd checked out the reviews for this a bit more thoroughly, I probably wouldn't have bothered with it. I was expecting a bit of comic book style fun, and this you get after a fashion, but they could have left out most of the rather laboured satire. Ironically, the more outrageously some of the characters behave, the more chillingly believable they become. Who knows what goes on in the world's star chambers? Maybe these Finnish guys have got it right, now there's a sobering thought! Visually the C.G.I. is a real feast even if none of it,( like the plot and dialogue,) makes much sense.Space-ships with radial piston engines? great big chains and gears every where doing nothing, etc. 1984 meets steam punk ? It works for Mr del Toro anyway. It's all just a send-up agreed, but it all could have been much better given the resources that were obviously expended on it. So far I'll admit I've been reduced to skipping through it and cherry-picking the visually most exciting bits, so how can I be reviewing a film I've not seen yet? Well, I suppose I'll nerve myself to sit through it all eventually, but regretfully I think this one's going to be another charity shop shelf filler. Come back Mel, all is forgiven. the world was never the same after 'Blazing Saddles'.",0

"An embassarment to atheism Can I say at the outset that, yes I have read the book.  And yes it was entertaining, but it was entertaining in the way that a tabloid rant is entertaining - I'd have expected this from Richard Littlejohn, not from esteemed professor Richard Dawkins.  Uncritical atheists and theists will delight and despair in equal measure but those acquainted with the God debate will be deeply frustrated by significant flaws in this book.    The first flaw is the arrogant tone.  Dawkins boldly asserts that science has rendered God obsolete and that all those open-minded enough to question and intelligent enough to look at the evidence will inevitably arrive at the same atheistic conclusion.  This argument is not only patronising, it completely ignores the large numbers of scientists (including such agnostics as Stephen Jay Gould) who accepts that science is simply incapable of adjudicating on the God question - science and religion are different disciplines using different tools, and asking different questions.    Secondly, Dawkins shows surprising ignorance when it comes to theistic belief.  Dawkins is an excellent scientist but a poor philosopher, and simply creates inaccurate and incorrect \\""""straw man\\"""" versions of theistic arguments.   Instead of seriously engaging with any leading contemporary theistic thinkers, Dawkins simply invents opponents with the oft repeated phrase, \\""""Let us imagine how a theist/apologist might respond\\"""".  This is simply unacceptable from someone of the stature of Dawkins, who at the outset advocated being open-minded and intellectually rigorous.    Most worryingly, Dawkins is extremely intolerant.  So convinced is he of the rightness of atheism and the wrongness of religion that he believes its \\""""malign influence\\"""" should be opposed.    Leaving aside the question of how he would go about this crusade against ¾ of the worlds population, Dawkins seems oblivious to the fact that he sounds exactly like the irrational fundamentalists he so despises.  Does hereally believe being brought up Catholic is worse than being molested and that sending children to Sunday School is tantamount to child abuse (yes he does really say this!)?    This is an entertaining account of Dawkins disbelief but is hardly a long-lasting contribution to the God debate. This is the Victor Meldrew approach to the question of God and it's an embarrassment to atheism.",0

And, although there were 3 or 4 pages right at the end that had me gripped, the last couple of pages were a total anti-climax.<br /><br />I really have no idea how it has received so many outstanding reviews.

"Unengaging Ian McEwan has always been a little \\""""hit or miss\\"""" in my mind. This novel sadly falls into the latter category. It is quite an achievement to take a beautiful, intelligent, blonde spy and turn her into a rather stupid dullard, with the emotional maturity of a 12 year-old. I presume the Brighton-based writer is a thinly disguised self-portrait but, if so, we are given no explanation of why Serena should fall in love with him. We are given some well-researched 70s history, in order to set the scene, but the book still feels as though it is set in the 30s and written in the 30s.<br />Oddly unengaging.",0

I cannot believe that after such a gap this is the best he has Hmm what to say about one of the most influential artists of the last 20 years - even when he isn't around for most of them. I have a couple of issues with SYRO one that maybe eased with time - the music and one that definately will not be - the production and sound palette.<br />I cannot believe that after such a gap this is the best he has. Am I the only one thinking that this is just an opening salvo for the goodies to come? I hope to god it is cos musically this is thin fare. Sketchy ideas scattered around at random no real development in the music no tension and a real lack of dynamics - but this could be the production again. This stuff sounds impressive at volume on a good studio set up - but imho it's a case of style over substance.<br />Now on to the real issue...the production and the sounds. Whilst technically correct the mix is horribly flat dynamically with the drum tracks dominating and preventing the more interesting stuff in the background from being properly listened to. Moving to the sounds he has employed I refuse to believe that he used all the instruments listed on the liner notes and failed to come with something more interesting sonically - it really is basic stuff and makes the whole thing sound like one of those awful demo tracks used to promote cheap Casio keyboards - is he making a point about simplicity or just having a laugh at our expense? I sure hope so cos this release sounds like the out takes from something else....can we have the something else soon please Richard,0

Fine does a remarkable job of illustrating why neuroscience - commonly held to be one of the &#34;hardest&#34; and most objective measure in behavioral study - is in fact subject to many of the same biases we see and reproduce all too often in everyday life, which is something everyone exposed to the popularization of its results (that is, nearly everyone) should recognise. &#34;Delusions of Gender&#34; deserves all the stars I can give it for its subject matter and impact alone, but Fine's sharp and witty style along with her thoroughness in exposing unwarranted scientific claims does nothing to diminish its impression.",1
"I felt cheated It's been a few years since I read this book, but the memory of how angry I became with it still sticks with me.<br /><br />I would have forgotten all of the flaws present if  the writer had the guts to follow her own storyline to the end. The flatness of most of the characters, the occasionally tedious chapters I had to force myself not to skip, the soap opera feel could all have been completely forgiven if I'd gotten that punch to the gut it promised.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I powered through that book, but not because I ever thought Anna was in danger of losing her kidney. Of course she wouldn't have been forced to give that up without her consent, the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm applies to the donor as well as the recipient. What I wanted to see was how each member of the family dealt with the consequences of her refusal.<br /><br />How long would Kate hang on without the kidney, and what would her last days be  like?  Would Kate's opinion of Anna's decision change as she approached death? How much would Anna's mother blame her for Kate's death? Would this be voiced or would it be a silent poison? How would this decision affect Anna while she's going through her turbulent teenage years? Would she still enjoy hockey, the sport that was one of the reasons she made her stand? Would she feel obliged to keep playing so she wouldn't waste that kidney? Would this drive Jesse deeper into his destructive behaviours? Would the marriage tighten or split apart?<br /><br />So many questions! And all of them, every single one is made meaningless by that idiotic twist ending. Anna was the sympathetic character, the one I wanted to see overcome and grow, hopefully with grace and dignity. Instead she's turned into the spare parts she never wanted to be, yet this is treated as some sugary sacrifice and inspiration. Kate's survival doesn't even make sense, since it had been stated earlier in the books that she wouldn't live even if she received a kidney.<br /><br />It honestly disgusted me and I refuse to pick up any of Jodi's other books to this day. Why should I, when the author might pull another cheap twist like this again?",0

"Publishing Disaster There can be little doubt that The Wheel of Time has been a fantasy masterpiece to rank alongside the very best. Robert Jordan's creation has been spellbinding in so many ways, and captivating for more than a decade.<br /><br />What a pity that it should end with a final volume that has clearly been stretched into two volumes for no other purpose than to eek every available penny from followers - for no true follower could fail to complete the series. Whilst A Memory of Light completes the story, the book itself is a disaster. The 'real' story meanders it's way between a catalogue of short sketches that exist only as fillers and which play no part in the main theme. Invented mini-plots detract from what should have been a tumultuous conclusion in ONE volume.<br /><br />Very disappointing from Mr Sanderson.",0

"Meh When I heard Red was coming out, I was really excited because I am quite a big fan of Taylor Swift. But I have to say, I'm slightly disappointed with it. There are some good tracks, but there are just quite a dew that I didn't really think much of. I expected it to be quite like her other albums with country with a hint of pop, but this album just sounds very poppy, which isn't a bad thing as such, I just found it quite dull.<br /><br />If you like Taylor Swift's new music, I'd say get it, but maybe wait for the price to go down or something.",0

"thats why god made the radio  beach boys i have been a bb fan all my life,right from their early BRIAN WILSON produced albums,then in the 70s,with the departure of BRUCE JOHNSTON,during the SURFS UP album,the bbs became more progressive,with the brilliant CARL AND THE PASSIONS and HOLLAND albums,which although a far cry from the BRIAN WILSON productions,were absolutely brilliant,in fact i think the bbs,would have been better going down this route,as they sounded so different,CARL AND THE PASSIONS had a raw quality,whilst HOLLAND sounded country,kind of like the EAGLES,or even OZARK MOUNTAIN DAREDEVILS.then we had the dreadful BRIAN IS BACK campaign,with 15 BIG ONES and LOVE YOU,which were dreadful,not only was BRIAN not back,but the bbs were trying to recapture,their previous 60s success and as far as i am concerned failed.things got better though,when BRUCE rejoined,in the late 70s and produced a couple of great albums,LA LIGHT and KEEPIN THE SUMMER ALIVE,the latter featuring a disco reworking of HERE COMES THE NIGHT,which i thought unusual and great and deserved to be a bigger hit.following a 5 year break,the bbs came to london and recorded THE BEACH BOYS album.what a turkey.they then had several compilations,which kept them in the public eye and i sort of lost track of them,though remaining a fan.all their back catalogue was re released on cd.NOW we have this latest offering and i have to say it is awful.the only good track is the title track,there are some clever harmonies,but we have lost DENNIS and CARL and this has reflected on the overall sound.i am convinced this will be the final bb album.i shall always be a fan and i understand that they have sold so many tickets for their wembley concert,that they have had to add an extra date.they are WELL worth seeing in concert.i was at knebworth in 1980.",0
"Some good - some not so! Have been a fan of PG's for years - so welcomed a new album - they don't come along very often!  This album is largely a re-working of his works, but with the addition of a full orchestra.  In short; some work - some miss the mark!     Can be quite tuneful in parts - but some of his 'darker' works get a little 'depressing' when combined with cello's and violins etc.  I saw the New Blood concert on Sky recently, and I'm afraid I have to say I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD  Oh well - I still live in hope of an album of the same strength and depth of 'So' or 'Us'  C'mon Pete!",0

"Codswallop A friend leant me this book with the best of intentions. It contains some of the stupidest and most unsubstantiated claims about human thoughts I've ever read.<br /><br />Yes it's true that many people go around in a negative mindset, which is unhealthy. We should all aspire to lead a positive thought-life (though this seems to require more effort in some folks than in others). Some modern psychotherapists would even claim that the connection between positive thoughts and general wellbeing is a recent discovery. Sorry folks, it's old news! Indeed it's been known for millennia (ref Philippians 4:8 written circa AD 61). As a general rule, our lives will move broadly in the direction of our most dominant thoughts. So yes, if you're struggling with an illness then focussing on the recovery rather than the condition will \\""""set the tone\\"""" for your subconscious mind. No-one is disputing that.<br /><br />Why this book loses all its credibility is the candour with which the author dismisses ALL other forces in the universe. For example, she would have her readers fantasise that you can ingest a large number of calories and remain slim merely by \\""""thinking\\"""". Duh. Hello? With respect, this is balderdash! A calorie is an amount of energy required to heat a substance to a particular temperature. If you eat three mince pies you'll ingest about 1,000 calories. You can't eat 3 mince pies and ingest only 200 calories merely by \\""""thinking\\"""". Get real!<br /><br />The Secret is probably helpful material for anyone who lives in a fantasy world. Otherwise, save your money!",0
Five Stars Grandchildren absolutely love this dvd.,1
"Jane Eyre - okay version I wanted to see this film when it came out at the cinema, but missed it.<br /><br />The opening scene of Jane running from Thornfield manor should have set the tone - a woman's inner conflict for the man she loves. It's merit is that it follows quite closely the original book, but it completely omits the character of Grace Poole.<br /><br />To be honest, I expected more.  Mia could have delivered the dialogue with more passion, but the underling passion between the two main characters was well acted.<br /><br />I would have loved to given it more than okay, but it is still worth watching if you love the author.",0
"9 years of waiting for 20 minutes of disappointment. (Spoilers) Spoilers ahead. While not being impossible, creating a series finale is hard. Wrapping up all lose ends, making sure all the characters have a equally good ending and creating an ending scenario which most can be happy with. It's a hard thing to do but it is needed for a series, especially one beloved by fans. The 'How I Met Your Mother' finale achieves none of this. Presenting us with a bad, cruel finale which rewards the viewer with a slap in the face. After 9 years of waiting for 'And that kid's, is how I met your mother' we're greeted with an ending scenario which makes us feel as we've been cheated and lied to since the very beginning. For the fabled 'Mother' now named Tracy is cruelly stamped on after years of waiting for the happy ending we all believed we were getting. She was a wall between a cruel ending scenario where Robin somehow gets together with Ted, the writer's knew this and decided to remove her with a unnamed illness with one line 'And she got sick'. That's it!? After years of waiting, we are welcomed with an unnamed illness which kills of the main character. The one in the fricking title?? Whatever game the writer's are playing, they really need to get their act together. In the end it show's Ted as a cruel bad man who uses the romantic, fateful story of how he met his mother as a way to get together with another women. That's just sick. And what happened to Barney? All the character development throughout the past couple of seasons thrown away as we are greeted with the same character we met in season 1? All that for nothing?<br />The season itself is pretty poor, it's only redeeming feature is the acting which is also let down by the exaggerated, comedy-sapping script. That's the only reason it get's more than 1 stars. I hope that they release an alternative ending just to give an ending which the fans deserve after 9 years of waiting for a season finale. All I can say is I'll be waiting.<br />Overall, the season itself is disappointing. Justbelow par. The season finale is plain dreadful and should never be aired again. It's defiantly nowhere near 'legendary'. This has destroyed the show for me, and while I may still watch the odd episode. I will never enjoy it as much as I should. 2/5 stars.",0

"Gentle Jazz! Well possibly Gone are the gentle folk songs of yesteryear, and the Jazz that was always in his routes has come to the fore. Not intricate or electric jazz, but a acoustic folk club jazz with double bass, reasonably relaxing, but with too much life to call it easy on the ear. The rhythms are from various influences that are difficult to pin down. Some of the lyrics are a little out of date to the real modern day, but that was always Donovans way, so we cannot hold this against him, as it is him. This is not the case with the whole CD.<br />The complete content is listenable because every song is different from the other, so boredom is not an issue, I can't honestly say this CD has much to show any great steps forward in the music world, but it is new for this particular artist, and for me breaths new life into him.",0

"Too much and not enough? Disclaimer: I'm not a big reader of fiction, so perhaps I can rule myself out from having an informed opinion -  the only sci-fi I've read would be Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey and Rama quartet and Childhood's End.<br /><br />Perhaps science fiction, more than any other genre of fiction, requires the most judicious editing skills: explain too little and the sprawling future worlds will be incomprehensible; explain too much and risk having the story bogged down with unnecessary detail and extrapolation. It is debatable whether Alastair Reynolds' debut novel, Revelation Space, manages to walk this fine line.<br /><br />Essentially, the story is simple in its premise: we have a zealous scientist driven to find the secret about the extinction of an alien race, a secret that could prove destructive to all of humanity and then there is a spaceship crew who is hunting down this man, one of whom is a secret assassin, all taking place around the year 2550, in a distant galaxy.<br /><br />I did find that Revelation Space was bursting with so much detail that there was just too much to take in: the shrouders, pattern jugglers, triumvirs, Ultras and more that I felt overloaded; again, this may be nothing to do with how Reynolds' writes but because I read so little fiction. For those of you more accustomed to the rules and conventions of science fiction, this may not be so much of an issue.<br /><br />Despite this, ultimately, the story was engaging, comprehensible and stimulating, enough so that I started Chasm City as soon as I finished Revelation Space.",0
"Wrong Version I specifically ordered the version read by Miriam Margolise and that is why I went to this seller, and not only did it arrive incredibly late, but when I got it it was the version read by Jolie Richardson.

"Wrong title This book should A. be in the fiction section and be called the \\""""irrational optimist\\"""". The fact that it is recomended by Boris Johnson should act as a warning. Although some of the info in it is interesting and correct the book is riddled with major errors. To be fair you have to read to page three before the first one, then they come thick and fast after that. Clearly Matt does not understand anything about climate change, farming (especialy the reality of MG crops)or peak oil production. My biggest gripe with the book is his argument is that you are a optimist or a pessimistic doom sayer, ignoring hard heaed realists that are between the two. He dodgers the key issue that the human race is breeding its self to extinction or the very least that our modern life style is not sustainable. Matt ignors \\""""sustainable state economics\\"""" which is a major omission. I wish Matt would face the reality that the human race is cosuming the resources of at least three planets. The current world modele of capatlism (I am a captalist)is dependant on continues growth which is not sustainable. The UK has a sustainable population of 35 million and is fast approaching a population of 70 million and the government has the cheek to talk about sustainble development.",0

"Id give it zero stars if i could. For anyone to find anything good about this bands music baffles me.Cool haircuts,cool name,and cool sleeves do not equate to being the new roses or mondays.Kasabian arent in the same universe as either of these two bands,let alone lace the boots of lesser,much-derided,but still great bands of the same ilk such as flowered-up,Nort hside,Shed7 or any other similar act youd care to think of.Id describe the lp as a dull,childish,bland, effort, borne from listening to breaking into heaven/begging you,being unable to recreate it cos their terrible players, so sounding like a bunch of clueless kids playing the only thing they can which has then been polished, and given an xtrmntr feel.so by default(lucky accident ) theyve ended up with a vaguely electronic sounding record.Such pretencious,pathetic nonsense is fine but becomes offensive when compared to real greatness.The Lofidelity Allstars were an anonymous bunch  with some epic tunes and will be remembered as such.This lack of image meant their commercial demise.Kasabian come along in a vaguely similar vain,but this time all image and NO tunes whatsoever,and perversely theyre hailed as the next big thing?I know im not the only music fan who is consistently enraged by the lack of justice in the world of music,and feel it is  my duty to highlight these facts when i read peoples ridiculous hype of shite like kasabian.",0

"A Good Read But . . . Having read the enthuasistic reviews for this book, and it being of a genre I usually enjoy, I was very much looking forward to reading the book. It is an interesting read in that it gives insite to other cultures, but ultimately I was a little disappointed in the parts of the book based in the 'western world' which I feel shows the west as habitual, predictable and lacking in gumption. Also disappointed in the predictability of the story as a whole.<br />My feeling was that, with a fantastic story line such as this, the book could have been a real 'wow'. As it stands, I found it a bit of a chore to finish.",0

"Leather ESV Study Bible - Unsafe Translation I recently invested in this bible knowing the translation is well done (especially compared to weaker version like the NIV). One has to remember there is still dynamic equivalence used in the ESV but the contributors behind the work include Prof JI Packer & Dr Wayne Grudem (reliable scholars and able theologians) and the lens for translation is clearly faithful Calvinistic theology.<br /><br />I bought the cowhide version as I wanted something that would last (let's face it - the ESV Study Bibles are not cheap) but I am a bit disappointed with the leather. It's an acceptable quality and inside the cover there's a second inner leather sheet stitched in so it's double thickness but it could really have done with a bit of padding as the cover is a bit light. The paper is a good quality bible paper you'd expect and the print is excellent, so is the layout and the illustrations.<br /><br />This is certainly a very helpful bible, there's guides and excellent articles and the cross references and comments on scripture are superb. Really this is an all round excellent investment for serious bible students - the only downside is (in my opinion) it is too expensive. A superb work nonetheless.<br /><br />====================<br /><br />I'm adding an update to this review to say that I am very disappointed after using the bible for a while I have found serious errors in the New Testament that reflect the choice of the Wescott and Hort translation manuscript which is very unreliable and was not apparent nor mentioned anywhere that I can find on the website or in the bible notes. This is a great mistake and without doubt the received text should have been used. I still use this bible for private study as it is helpful in the notes etc but I cannot in all conscience preach from it when I believe the translation is not accurate. There are various instants of the Name of Christ being completely omitted from the text.<br /><br />Very unhappy.",0

"So Disappointed. I have just finished the latest installment, in what I have always professed to be my favourite author/series. Imagine my utter disappointment to find that this book (much like Echo) is almost...terrible.<br /><br />Oddly enough I have just finished reading the first book once again, maybe its with this comparison freshly in my mind that led me to this conclusion. The story goes absolutely nowhere, nothing is explained and for the most part its filled with random unconnected snatches of different stories. For example - (SPOILERS)<br /><br />Rodger and Bree- they've come to the ridge... how and why? Where was that conversation and reasoning.<br /><br />Another house fire? Really?!<br /><br />What the hell did Jane or Fanny have to do with anything?<br /><br />We spent the whole book trying to find Ben. We still havent found him. Why not?<br /><br />Why was is important for Rodger to go wandering around Scotland, achieve nothing and then find his family anyway?<br /><br />Claire gets shot... ok. Claire recovers.<br /><br />Claire's married to Lord John... then isnt. Just like that.<br /><br />I really could go on. I understand that Diana must keep her readers wanting more, thats part of the fun isnt it, but I really felt like the soul of her writing just isnt there anymore. Nothing like the previous books at all. It feels like shes just writing the stories but not really thinking about what shes writing. So we end up with this brain fodder.<br /><br />On another note there were parts of the story that I absolutely loved. How could I not, ive been in love with these books for 10 years? Theres humourous moments and tear filled moments that I enjoyed thoroughly.<br /><br />I just hope that Diana takes notice of her fans comments (not just the gushing praise) and tries to bring the final book(s) back to the Jamie and Claire that we're used to, because if not ill feel like i've wasted a huge part of my reading life.",0

"VERY DISAPPOINTING For a book which is sold on the reputation of Stephen Hawking (whose name on both cover and spine is bigger than the title), this is a very disappointing read.<br /><br />Less than one third of the book is devoted to \\""""the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe\\"""" (ie the multiverse, top-down theory of cosmology, and unified M-theory), and there is not enough detail to get more than a vague understanding of it.  Most of the book is devoted to a potted history of physics from the Greeks onwards; detailed descriptions of interference of waves (c.1800) and Feynman's \\""""alternative histories\\"""" explanation of the famous double-slit experiment (c.1940), a description of Conway's \\""""Game of Life\\"""" (c.1970), and discussions of what are meant by \\""""laws of nature\\"""" and \\""""reality.\\""""  These old topics are described in detail, but their relevance to M-theory is not clearly spelt out. When we get to the complex ideas, there is far less explanation.<br /><br />The book left me with many key questions unanswered.  Is the \\""""multi-verse\\"""" an infinite number of REAL universes, or just a useful IMAGINARY concept like the square root of minus one?  If these universes are real, where are they, and can we detect them?  What effect do they have on each other?  How do the hidden (\\""""curled-up\\"""") dimensions of the universe influence fundamental properties such as the charge and mass of the electron?  If the universe has many \\""""alternative histories\\"""", how come only one (the Big Bang story) has made it into the textbooks? How are these \\""""alternative histories\\"""" related to the \\""""multi-verse\\"""". This book gives no answers to these obvious questions.<br /><br />And crucially, if M-theory is a scientific model of the universe (see p 68), what testable predictions does it make?  None are put forward in this book.  (The \\""""test\\"""" on page 182-3 is a comparison with existing observations, not a prediction.)  Consequently, the claim that M-theory is \\""""the [Grand] Unified Theory which Einstein was hoping to find\\"""" is far from convincing.<br /><br />The book is described as \\""""lavishly illustrated\\"""", having 8 artistic plates, 38 colour illustrations and 7 cartoons.  However, many of the \\""""lavish\\"""" illustrations are poor \\""""illustrations\\"""" of the text; some seem to have no purpose other than as \\""""eye candy.\\""""  For example: the \\""""artist's impression\\"""" (!) of Feynman's van (page 137).  (Why not a photo of the actual van, if it is really worth including?!)  The book is sprinkled with humor, but this is often infantile.  For example: \\""""There might be one history [of our universe] in which the moon is made of Roquefort cheese.  But we have observed that the moon is not made of cheese, which is bad news for mice\\""""  (page 179).  The cartoon on page 143 is amusing (\\""""Putting a box around it, I'm afraid, does not make it a unified theory\\""""); it is probably directed at the Standard Model, but it could equally well apply (ironically) to M-theory as described in this book.<br /><br />The best I can say for this book is that it is interesting, the language is simple and straightforward, and there are some useful insights, such as comparing rolled-up dimensions to a straw.<br /><br />The blurb claims that this book is \\""""succinct\\"""" but it certainly doesn't \\""""get straight to the point\\"""".  It also claims that it gives \\""""new answers to the ultimate questions about the universe\\"""", but these are, in my opinion, outclassed by the genuinely succinct (and no less informative) old answer offered by Douglas Adams - \\""""42\\"""".ng to find\\"""" is far from convincing.<br /><br />The book is described as \\""""lavishly illustrated\\"""", having 8 artistic plates, 38 colour illustrations and 7 cartoons.

"This book has everything, apart from a coherent argument Blink is well-written with a fluent, enjoyable style, and is full of amusing vignettes to catch your interest. By the end, though, I was a little confused as to when it's okay to 'thin-slice', and when the author thinks we shouldn't. Gladwell introduces us to experts who can marshal their knowledge and experience of their subject to make reliable snap judgements in the blink of an eye. Then we meet other experts whose immense knowledge actually becomes clutter that gets in the way of reliable quick decision-making. And then we have anti-experts whose disdain for academic and theoretical knowledge enables them to come out tops in the thin-slicing stakes. And then we have the complete know-nothings of our world who, not surprisingly, guess wrongly about more or less everything. <br /> <br />And so the roundabout turns, all through the book. If you're seeing a pattern in all of it, then you're doing better than me. <br /> <br />I was particularly irritated by a section in chapter six where Gladwell toys with a concept he calls \\""""temporary autism.\\"""" He is examining the question of why, in extreme life-threatening situations, sometimes 'thin-slicing' works and sometimes it has disastrous consequences. Sometimes a police officer fires a gun at an armed criminal and saves the lives of innocent people; other times they shoot an innocent person and end up in court on a murder charge. In such fight-or-flight situations, an increase in heart-rate sends our bodies into a kind of survival mode -- that is, our nervous systems basically close down anything that isn't essential to dealing with the immediate crisis. Our perception of time slows down; we become prone to tunnel-vision; and our interpretation of other people's behaviour becomes more than usually reliant on stereotyping, rather than an emotionally-nuanced reading of the other person's mental state. The disastrous cases are the ones in which this process has gone too far and heightened arousal has given way to panic. Gladwell compares the 'mind blindness', as he calls it, of people in this situation with the indifference to social stimuli that is characteristic of autism -- autistic people typically have an inability to 'read' the emotions of others, and in fact look upon other people much as they would a chair or a table, as objects with no inner life. Gladwell argues that people in extreme stress, who have temporarily lost their ability to reason and read emotional signals, are \\""""effectively autistic\\"""" at that particular time; their state of 'mind blindness' is, he thinks, a state of \\""""temporary autism.\\""""  <br /> <br />But you don't need to be a psychologist to see how weak that comparison is. The author has simply picked out one characteristic of autism, noted that a similar characteristic appears to be present when a person is in fight-or-flight mode, and then announced that the two conditions are \\""""effectively\\"""" the same. And that, unfortunately, is characteristic of the slipshod thinking that permeates this book. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an entertaining read, and a useful jumping-off point perhaps for more serious investigations. But the book doesn't really add up to a coherent whole -- it's more like a collection of amusing shaggy-dog stories without a punchline. <br />",0

"Just ... wow Prior to reading this book I have never felt the need to write a review before but this book is just otherworldly and I feel somewhat compelled to make my feelings toward it heard.<br /><br />I've had this book sat on my shelf for a week or so now and i finally got around to reading it over the past couple of days and haven't been able to stop. As a reader who isn't normally into books such as this, it was for me an incredible read and has opened me up to a new genre. With a gripping story line and being very well written it has become very quickly one of my favourite books I have ever read (and I am a big reader). I highly suggest this book to everybody but suggest you have some tissues at the ready near the end.",1

"Confused Musically I like this album but some of the 'lyrics' are just diabolical. There is no real flow to the lyrics, he just seems to let out random rants. They sound like they have been written by an excited pubescent teen thats just seen a porno for the first time. Embarrasing. It's like he has lost touch with his roots and is just saying random things for shock value. Judging by some of the reviews on here it seems to have worked and no doubt the album is selling millions. I am sure true hip hop fans will be indifferent to this album, not that I am sure you could truly call it a hip hop album. Musically it is more like electronica and you will either love it or loathe it. Personally I quite enjoyed it musically but some of the rantings are just cringeworthy. Also I don't think it is as clever as Mr West thinks as it has been done before, just not as an 'hip hop' album. Try Macklemore and Lewis, ASAP Rocky or Kendrick Lemar if you want to hear some great lyrics about real issues.",0
"The Fault in Our Stars Let me start out by saying that this book ripped my heart from my chest, crumpled it and then proceeded to throw it on the ground and trample on it in the most beautiful way imaginable.<br />I was slightly hesitant going into this book as I don't read many contemporary novels, and it was so hyped up by both friends and reviews I've read/seen about it that I was sure I was in for some major disappointment.<br />I couldn't have been more wrong. John Green's writing is something I rarely find, the kind where I never stumble over a word in mid-sentence because it flows so perfectly. The story itself was just phenomenal. I fell in love with the characters, I laughed at the dark humor, I cried continuously for a good five or six chapters and no word of a lie I have never cried at a book before (I tend to have somewhat of an ice heart).<br />Please, please do not be put off by the hype this book has received, it truly is warranted, and even if, like me, you don't tend to read much contemporary give it a go. This is one of those books that I feel pretty much most people could find enjoyment in. I already have a list of friends and family members that I will be loaning this book to because in my humble opinion everyone needs to experience the flawlessness that is The Fault in Our Stars.<br />  A.",1

"This is crap! Jesus, this movie is horrible. Ok, lead character Corky looks gorgeous, but whether you look at this as an erotic movie, lesbian movie, thriller or whatever, it doesn't take away the fact that the movie sucks. The actors are bad, the caracters are morons, the story line is predictable and stupid and the soundtrack is not very clever either. I don't normally dislike movies to this degree, but... give me a break!",0
"Mutually Exlcusive The term Mutually Exclusive means to choose only one out of two. You can choose either the movie or the video game of the Resident Evil franchise.<br /><br />Being a fan of the games, I found that this film was tiresome and unfaithful to the source material. New characters are added, new settings and story lines are included to. This isn't a bad thing, but the way it is done is bad (if that makes sense). Here, we cast aside Jill Valentine to a bit part and present Alice (a character found only in the movies), who is played well by Milla Jovovich. I have no problems here, she saves the movie.<br /><br />Onto setting and storyline. Now don't get me wrong, I like innovation as much as the next guy. But they probably would have been better off if this franchise DID follow the cannon of the games. In this we can see it uses the popular elements from the video games. Not a problem. The final monster in this is \\""""The Tyrant\\"""" (Fans of the PS1 RE1 would know this). In the game it was a pretty difficult boss and further more actually scary! Here, it is a tiresome, whiny creature which sounds like it's hitting the high note from the song \\""""loving you\\"""". I mean, honestly! Nothing wrong with the actor but the writing! The Tyrant is meant to be scary! He was about as intimidating as that Jareth the Goblin King.<br /><br />My favourite piece of trivia in regards to this film is that it is director by Russell Mulcahy. For the avid movie goer that name would ring a bell as the director of Highlander 2: The Quickening (considered one of the worst movies of all time). Watching this, I pined for the planet Zeist and Michael Ironside chewing the scenery like it was bubblegum.<br /><br />But who knows, you may enjoy it and that's ok. I just feel if you like the games you would have a difficult time enjoying the movie. It borrows from the games but translates it terribly! Although, I may still be scornful after they made NEMESIS into a good guy in the 2nd film! :/. But, that is a story for another day.",0

"Don't Be cynical about not hearing this album, its VERY GOOD mostly. Of the later Blur albums, this one is much more of a stand out.<br />Even without Graham Coxon (an essential formula to Blurs success)...it sounds far more clever and creative.<br /><br />Some good b sides to, like &#34;Don't Be&#34; which remind you a lot of the 94, Parklife album era of the band, not sure why that one didn't make in favor of some of the other &#34;slow drudgers&#34; that replaced it.<br /><br />I think its a much better record and much more of a &#34;Blur&#34; record than 13 or the self titled one.<br />Its more sure of what it is.<br />And if you don't like some of the songs, just replace them with the b sides you do like, they are even better.<br /><br />Really this album kind of got ignored quite a bit. Its sad how it was the last Blur album for a long while. It would of been interesting to hear what they came up with had they continued without Graham. He would of rejoined eventually so it would of been a good chance to explore a new side of the band. But unfortunately Damon Albarn favors Gorrilaz or at the time he did anyway, so we all had to listen to more of that.<br /><br />But Blur without Graham on guitar is just as good as with him, even if it isn't quite the same thing perhaps.<br /><br />One of the better Blur albums this one. I also think its better than their new one The Magic Whip which to me sounds a bit confused of what sort of a band or record it actually wants to be.",1

"Failed attempt Like many die-hard fans I had huge expectations for this record. Faith no More never disappointed me, they've been one of my favorites bands (if not my favorite) for so many years; I can clearly remember the day a friend mine gave me a mixtape with &#34;surprise you're dead&#34; on it, I was hooked. I overcame the fact that Jim Martin wasn't part of the band anymore (Jon Hudson is a fine replacement), put Angel Dust in my personal holy shrine, loved K.F.D.F.L. and enjoyed The Album of the Year and his dramatic tone.<br />Weeks before this release I started to read overwhelming reviews by several medias and I felt really excited.. Man I'm so disappointed, I've listened to it several times and the verdict remains the same : a half-baked album, with several fillers. Sol Invictus is not a bad album, many bands would be more than happy to release a record like this one but by Faith No More standards, it doesn't make it. I never been the kind of person who wants his favorite band to release the same record again and again but Sol Invictus really lacked heaviness, the production isn't on par with their previous albums and 39 minutes later I can't help but think : all that fuss for that?!<br />Superhero, Separation Anxiety, Rise of the fall are excellent, Cone of Shame sounds very Tomahawk, Motherf** is a good b-side and Sunny Side Up is hard to swallow (and that´s an understatement). As for the rest of the songs I already forgot about them.",0

"Lacking in both style and substance. This book is mostly based on Lodge's own experience. To my mind it is completely spoiled by the fact that these experiences have not been properly digested. He has not taken the distance from them which is necessary for writing a decent book.  At times it is far too longwinded and smacks of self-pity. The style of writing alternates irritatingly between past and present and between first and third person. It seems to be cobbled together from bits of the author's life (his marriage, his work, deafness, trip to Auschwitz, his father) which don't have an intrinsic link. He did not manage to rouse my interest, only irritation. Though I did finish it, but that was only for lack of something better by my bedside!",0

"NOT A CLASSIC BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN ALBUM I had read quite a few reviews of this album release and was very unsure as to what I should expect as they ranged from terrible through to classic, so I decided that the best way to make up my own mind was to bite the bullet and purchase it. As the title to this review suggests, this is not by any manner or means a classic Bruce Springsteen offering, and I do have most of his back catalogue, but it could be described as a pleasing enough offering in the vien of 'Tunnel of Love', 'Lucky Town' or 'Human Touch'. In other words, not disappointing, but not a Springsteen album you would recommend to someone unfamiliar with his work if you really wanted to convert that someone to his genius. I had noticed that 2 seperate reviewers made reference to the similarity of the title track and a Teddy Thompson song 'In My Arms' infering some form of plagiarism on behalf of 'The Boss'. Yes both songs are very very similar, but both are credited as being composed in 2008. I don't really give a hoot if either Springsteen or Teddy Thompson copied each other, because in the case of Teddy Thompson's, 'In my Arms' this is the only good track on a totally rubbish album, whereas 'Working on a Dream' is a good track on an average album. Burce's worst efforts will easily surpass Teddy Thompson's best.    So what are the good and bad tracks contained within this colloection?     I would have to say that there are no bad tracks, but that the small number of good or exceptional tracks are not sufficient to lift the entire package above the average. I enjoyed 'Outlaw Pete' (Yes the story is a little far fetched, but who cares) even though it was a little reminiscent of Pete Seeger (A so called liberal folk singer who wasn't liberal enough to accept Bob Dylan going electric!). My Lucky Day, Working On A Dream, Good Eye,and The Wrestler could all be regarded as highlights. If you are already familiar with the work of 'The Boss' this is worth getting. If you are not, then may I suggest you start elsewhere first. (anything from Greetings From Asbury Park through to The Ghost of Tom Joad)",0

"So disappointed... Wow. I'm a huge fan of Take That, I've loved them since the early 90s and up until now, loved most of what they have done. After a second listen, I'm afraid this album does not match the standard of their previous albums.    The Flood is a great start to the album, but it's all downhill from there. SOS has a good beat and is quite catchy and I quite liked the strings on Wait. But then there are no redeeming factors on the album until Flowerbed, the final (hidden) track sung by Jason, which is the best song on the album, bar The Flood. Robbie has far too many leads on this album, I almost feel as though he has taken over and unfairly oversahdowed the rest of the group.    I still love TT, but I am hugely disappointed by this album - especially as I forked out for the 'deluxe' edition!",0

I truly feel that the success of 'Twilight' has simply lowered the bar for vampire fiction, and from now on female protagonists will be pretty but fragile things waiting on their Edward, or in the case of this book, Matthew. In my opinion this book draws very heavily from both the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises and while the basic premise started out promising enough the entire novel de-evolved into almost unreadable shlock. This is only compounded once one realises just how much of that shlock there is to get through. The entire thing is unnecessarily long, with the author drawing on the same phrases over and over again (I was quite tempted to mark each time that hair was drawn behind an ear, or the female lead commented on the smell of cloves) making the reader feel incredibly frustrated as the plot plods at a snail's pace. With only a few bright points in the story, the characters Ysabeau and Marthe being one, by the middle of the book one feels alienated from the story entirely, or unable to care what happens to the weak, predictable characters.     Unless a serious reworking of the next novel and its characters is forthcoming, I have no personal interest in a sequel and I do hope that the author considers putting aside all the regurgitation of other works so that something new and original can emerge.",0

"Music Sampler Of Trance/Electronic Hybrids Tomorrowland 2013: Arising Of Life caught my attention due to my previous enjoyment of the 2012 series.  Additionally, I stumbled across the official Tomorrowland music channel that is on youtube. Their official youtube channel is a perfect place to visit if you would like to hear extended samples of the songs available on Tomorrowland 2013.  Tomorrowland 2013: The Arising of Life is a two disc (double cd set) that has 26 tracks on the first cd and 15 music sets on the second cd.  My personal favorite from this collection is Like Home by Nicky Romero & Nervo.  However, many more gifted musicians are featured on this collection such as Zedd, Martin Garrix, Alesso, Armin Van Buuren, Trevor Guthrie, Hardwell & Diro feat. Bright Lights, Yves V and more. A complete track listing is currently available on Amazon Germany.",1

"Tsk I suppose FM should be applauded for not repeating 'Rumours', but what 'Tusk' reveals is that they were not very good at being different. There's nothing wrong with settling for excelling at the tried and tested if no one can beat you at it; a blend of rock, pop, folk, blues and country was the strength of this line-up.  'Tusk' does have a parallel with The Beatles' 'white album' in that FM strip away the embellishments of their most famous release, leaving a spare, intimate, almost demo feel to the recordings. In this case, however, a considerable loss of quality results. Lindsey Buckingham's ten songs harbour the offbeat stuff. Tracks such as 'The Ledge' sound like rockabilly played on rubber bands and a dustbin lid. Novel, yes, progressive, no.  Stevie Nicks has the best songs here in every sense: captivating lyrics, hypnotic melodies and enchanting arrangements. Her five epics - they are the longest tracks - would pass muster on the two previous albums. 'Sara', 'Sisters of the Moon' and 'Beautiful Child' particularly stand out, but 'Angel' and 'Storms' are not far behind. Christine McVie reminds us what a great voice she has, but aside of 'Brown Eyes' her other four songs are filler. Add Buckingham's title track and 'Walk a Thin Line' and there's just about enough material to make a good single album, composed mostly of what FM do well.",0
Not there best work Received my copy a day before release day and to be honest on first listen it didn't really grab my attention like the last album did.I'm not saying it's a bad album just there's nothing new here.songwriting is faultless as I would expect from tony clanking just wish I could say same about bobs voice which at times did make me wince maybe age is catching up with him.overall not bad effort with some nice licks but sorry guys only 5/10 from me,0

"Pre-2010 Eminem I confess that I decided to purchase Eminem Curtain Call-The Hits after spotting the cd at my Walmart job. I had previously enjoyed Eminem's 2010 Recovery cd back in 2011 and figured that this greatest hits by Eminem collection would be a perfect music complement. There are fifteen tracks on this edition featuring two different versions of Stan (one featuring Dido and the other that includes a live version with Elton John).  Thereare a good assortment of Eminem's popular hits on Curtain Call such as My Name Is, The Way I Am, Without Me, Like Toy Soldiers, When I'm Gone etc.  I admit that Lose Yourself is one of my favorites from this greatest hits collection based on the motivational message. This is also due to the positive/uplifting memories of hearing Lose Yourself after watching the Eight Mile movie (in Japan back around January 2003) with my husband (during our first official month together as boyfriend/girlfriend). Eminem Curtain Call-The Hits are a good collection for those who like any of Eminem's songs.",1

"Some great songs but as an album it pushes in three directions, only one is successful There are really three albums here.  A generic electro-pop album can be found on tracks 1, 2, 7, 8, 16 and 17.  An interestingly eccentric electro-pop album can be made from tracks 3, 4, 5 and 18-21.  And an album of ballads with a more organic, less synth based sound can be found in the middle of the album over tracks 9-15, 22 and 23.    By far and away the most interesting stuff is the oddball electro-pop songs.  They are almost weird and strange enough to rival Lady Gaga.  Due to record company intervention (or something) most of these tracks ended up on the bonus disc instead of on the main album itself.  So for perhaps the first time ever the deluxe version is authentically worth buying.  If you buy the standard version then you're not getting many of the best songs.      1. Bionic (5 out of 10 stars)  Middle of the road electro-pop of zero distinction.  Lady Gaga has nothing to fear.    2. Not Myself Tonight (6 stars)  Nice use of swearing.  Has a decent big beat to it but it's not as heavy and brutally no prisoner taking as it should be.  Unremarkable and workmanlike.    3. Woohoo feat. Nicki Minaj (8 stars)  Eccentric song about oral sex with a good sample of the title repeated throughout.  Not subtle but effective.  Lyrically pretty bold.    4. Elastic Love (9 stars)  Lyrically very eccentric and musically rather odd.  A very interesting song.  The best song on the album.  Apparently the word \\""""spastic\\"""" doesn't have offensive connotations in America.    5. Desnudate (7 stars)  Strong track with some foreign language vocals and what sounds like a horn section.  Lyrically suggestive of something kinky.    6. Love & Glamour (intro) (5 stars)  Pointless spoken word intro to the next song.  Why it's sequenced as a separate track I have no idea?    7. Glam (6 stars)  Lyrically a bit girly for my tastes.  Musically perfectly fine but not particularly memorable or notable.  Rather indifferent overall.    8. Prima Donna (4 stars)  By numbers electro-pop.  Bland and lyrically very uninspired.  Filler album track.    9. Morning Dessert (intro) (2 stars)  The album drops the electro-pop direction and turns into an album of more organic sounding ballads.  This is a horrible mid-tempo track that has a start and then just stops.  Pointless filler.  It sets up the next song but it's not as if Sex For Breakfast needs to be set up with an overture.    10. Sex For Breakfast (4 stars)  Lyrically connected to the previous song.  Tepid lightweight R&B that reminds me of Vivian Green (shudder!!).  Not very interesting musically or lyrically.  Harmless.    11. Lift Me Up (1 star)  I'm sure it's all very competent etc but I thought it was drippy clichéd BS.  Music created to the big ballad formula.  All soul but without any trace elements of soul.  Terrible.    12. My Heart (Intro) (1 star)  Spoken word crap.  Why do musicians think anyone cares that they had a kid?  Kate Bush pushed her kid at us on the mistaken belief that everyone was fascinated.  At least Christina hasn't built songs around her kid (as far as I can tell) and instead restricted most of it to this track.    13. All I Need (2 stars)  Dumb lyrics put to electro-pop is fine, but dumb clichéd lyrics put to slower piano music is just not on.  At least it's fairly short.    14. I Am (6 stars)  Wow, a ballad with a pulse!  Musically decent but the lyrics are a bit so-so.    15. You Lost Me (4 stars)  I can't work up any enthusiasm for this mid-tempo ballad.  All a bit insipid but at least it has some sweeping loud parts.    16. I Hate Boys (7 stars)  The album now reverts back to electro-pop after that long run of back to back ballads.  This is a solid but unremarkable song.    17. My Girls feat. Peaches (7 stars)  Has a more convincing electronic beat to it than the previous song.    18. Vanity (8 stars)  A strong, interesting song.  The lyrics are easy to interpret as arrogant, but I think she's aware of how over the top they are and is in on the joke at her own expense.      Bonus Disc:    19. Monday Morning (8 stars)  Strangely restrained, laid back electro-pop.  A strong confident song with an easy unforced charm to it.    20. Bobblehead (9 stars)  Very eccentric dissing song.  Nice (for us) and nasty (for the subject).  As it's probably the second best song this should definitely have made it onto the main album.  Reminds me of the song Hollywood by Marina and the Diamonds.    21. Birds Of Prey (8 stars)  Strong song with a more epic, expansive feel to it then Christina usually aims for.    22. Stronger Than Ever (7 stars)  Up-tempo ballad that's much, much better than any of the ballads that made it onto the proper album.  Even the lyrics are fine.    23. I Am (Stripped) (6 stars)  Solid alternative mix of a song that's on the main album.  The differences don't seem all that important so I have no hardcore opinion on what version is best.      It's a bit of a mess and way overlong for a pop album.  If ever there was an album designed to be played around with using iTunes playlists then this is it.  Perhaps they never even expected anyone to play it from start to finish after the first week of purchase.  Personally I find it odd that they sequenced all the ballads back to back, which almost makes it feel like they've plonked a whole separate EP of ballads into the middle of an electro-pop album.    I like to make EP playlists out of some albums on my iPod. Tracks 3, 4, 5 and 18 made the cut (I've deliberately ignored the bonus disc for this).    My alternative 10 track 40 minute album version:      3. Woohoo     4. Elastic Love     5. Desnudate     7. Glam     17. My Girls     18. Vanity     19. Monday Morning     20. Bobblehead     21. Birds Of Prey     22. Stronger Than Ever         Do not buy the single disc version.  The bonus disc is not just rubbish studio off-cuts.  Some of the best tracks are on there.",0

"American sound As a classic rock fan, I was really looking forward to receiving this album. However, all I can say is it's OK but it's not brilliant. Sometimes it takes a while for an album to grow on me, which is fair enough, but I'm put off by Chris Ousey's annoying vocal style. All he does is &#34;belt it out&#34;, he has no dynamics or versatility, he sounds pretty much like Jon Bon Jovi, with just as little soul. This gives the whole album a very American feel - maybe this is exactly what they set out to achieve. All in all it's not bad, just nothing special. With Micky Moody and Neil Murray on board, I imagine the quality of music would have been lifted a notch or two if Bernie Marsden had been involved.",0

50 shades of crap!!!!! I bought this because of all the hype surrounding the book and i can honestly say it is the worst piece of literature i have ever read! It seems to me as if it was intended for gullible teenage girls written by a complete amateur and quite how any intelligent person could enjoy this book is beyond me! The amount of repetitive drivel in this book is unbelievable but having said that fair play to the author as he/she is a very wealthy person now thanks to all the foolish sheep that have bought this book on hearsay and gossip (including me)!,0

"Weird. A disappointing comeback if you ask me... There's only a few songs that really do it for me. 'Suit and Tie', 'Mirrors', 'Tunnel Vision' & 'Let the Groove Get In'.

"Not dark - just cynical exploitation of great childrens classic I'm slightly surprised at the number of people saying that this is a \\""""darker\\"""" more interesting retelling of this story.  To me it came across as a cynical exercise in turning the surreal and mysterious into the mundane, predictable and overtly commercial.   There's plenty of \\""""dark\\"""" elements in the original Lewis Carol story that has been airbrushed out of previous film adaptations. You would have thought that Burton would be the person to carry off the perfect homage to Lewis Carol and the fact that he fails so spectacularly makes you wonder what sort of interference he was getting from the suits at Disney.  The basic problem is that Burton takes away the bizarre and surreal aspect of Carol and shoe horns in a very predictable story template seen in every fantasy film that has sought to emulate the success of the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter franchise.   This is the underrated hero finding inner strength to fight a seemingly invincible foe and taking part in a climatic battle that frees a world from tyranny. Think about how many films follow this format and you will realise how lazy and lacking in creativity it is to follow the archetypal hero story in a Lewis Carol setting.  I didn't think the acting was bad or the effects out of place; just that the screen play was plodding, un-inventive and without any spark.  The attempts to forge 21 century ideas about relationships and values into Victorian setting I found cringe worthy, particularly the way in which the Hatter friendship with Alice unfolds. Quite frankly, it had me reaching for the sick bucket.  If you think special effects are the be all and end of movies ( and lets face it the Hollywood studios bank on that ) and you don't mind your plots wafer thin you may well enjoy this. Personally I found it ironically one dimensional and I'm very glad I didn't shell out forty quid for the family to watch it in 3D at the cinema.",0

"MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE AUTHOR'S MOTIVES Before I purchased this book I wrongly assumed that James lived on the street and had no choice than to take Bob everywhere with him.  However, it became evident very early in book that James did in fact live in a flat.  Although James and Bob are obviously devoted to each other I cannot but question James motives in taking Bob everywhere with him in all weathers.  I do not believe cats are happy on buses, tubes and busy streets of London.  I am sure Bob would have been happier at home in the warm especially during autumn and winter months.  I am a cat lover/owner for some 50 years and have had indoor cats, some outdoor cats and ferals living with me at different times.  But..... NONE of them ever enjoyed going out in the cold and wet weather.  James tells us time and time again about his love for Bob - but if he truly cared about him I dont think we would be reading this book!!  James says he had only two bad experiences with Bob, when he run off, but I believe it would have been far more times than this.  In the early days he either carried him about or kept him on a shoelace - how safe was that?  I feel that James exploited Bob and the reason he took him busking and selling the Big Issue was because he knew he could make far more money with him than on his own.  I cannot blame other buskers and Big Issue sellers for resenting this.  He also tells us he was living from hand to mouth most of the time with Bob, yet when his mother paid for his air ticket to visit her in Australia, he had to quickly find £500.00 himself to enter the country - he managed to save the £500.00 in just three weeks selling the Big Issue!!  I have awarded 3 stars for this book for Bob - who I think is a beautiful, intelligent and friendly cat.  Sorry but I still have doubts about the author.",0

"'The Best Collection of Frank Zappa Songs Available on a Commercial Release Entitled 'The Best of Frank Zappa' - EVER! I bought this just to have some of Zappa's songs all in one place, and what a fine collection it is.  This album gives an, albeit limited, overview of FZ's songs.  With as prolific an output as his, it would be nigh on impossible to do him justice but it comes close. Pretty much all of his musical  peccadiloes and lyrical predilections are in evidence and his most successful albums appear to be represented.  However,since these are Zappa songs, there are also some great instrumental breaks too e.g the guitar solo in 'Cosmik Debris' to name but one.  Further listening reveals details that are easily missed first time around- some of the tiny flourishes, especially in the 'Apostrophe/Overnite Sensation' cuts, are more than just icing on the cake, they elevate the songs to a higher level (I don't suppose they'd lower them there).  The backing vocals on 'Overnite Sensation' are provided by the Ikettes and are stunning.<br />Personally, and probably along with most other Zappa fans, I think this could easily have been a double CD.  I'd love to have seen 'Uncle Remus', 'St.Alphonzo's Pancake Breakfast', 'Fifty Fifty', 'Trouble Every Day', 'Can't Afford No Shoes', 'Andy', 'Let's Make the Water Turn Black', 'Cocaine Decisions', 'Lucille', 'Catholic Girls', 'Keep it Greasy', 'Packard Goose', 'The Torture Never Stops', 'City of Tiny Lites', 'It Might Just Be a One Shot Deal', 'You are What You is', 'Goblin Girl', 'Heavenly Bank Account' ('remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over'!),'The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing', 'Brown Shoes Don't Make it', 'What's the Ugliest Partof Your Body?', and a live version of 'Whippin' ost'.  'Disco Boy' I could have done without, but it's a small price to pay for what is a good collection.<br />Apart from that, I'm happy with this collection!<br />Recommended to anyone even remotely curious about FZ's music.",1

"Except that Alexandre is in a much better club than this The reviewed is 1996 Harcourt Brace & Co, hardcover edition.<br /><br />Nominated (by the publisher) for a few genre awards which it failed to win.  The author has never scored award recognition or received further nominations. Undistinguished, I think, is the right word to describe this writer and he knocks out his novels at an average rate of one per year.<br /><br />Allowing for the translation, yet his prose style is excruciating. Just for example, I'm going to open the book entirely at random and copy some lines,<br /><br />\\""""... The victory had been imaginary. It was like defeating imaginary ghosts, or punching the wind, or shouting at silence. Maybe that's why Corso was now staring suspiciously at the city suspended in the mist, waiting, before entering it, to make sure that its foundations were firmly rooted in the ground.<br />  He could hear the girl's gentle, rhythmic breathing at his shoulder. He stared at her bare neck between the folds of the duffel coat. He moved his hand until he could feel the heat of her warm flesh throbbing in his fingers.\\""""<br /><br />Yes, and that's not all that's throbbing after being battered over the head with several tons of similar stuff.<br /><br />In a way, I'm annoyed with myself.  See; the novel refers heavily to books by Dumas and a reader would need to be familiar with a good body of that work to follow the story readily.  But anyone who knows that much about Dumas should totally know better than to get involved with something like The Club Dumas.<br /><br />The story combines two parts; a supernatural mystery and a noir-ish thriller.  Neither of these strands are brought to pleasing conclusions.  The thriller bit involves people acting like they are characters in The Three Musketeers - which is so horribly contrived that around page 300 it became too insufferable to read and I started skimming.  The supernatural stuff is intriguing at first.  The premise is culled from an old French fantasy romance called The Devil inLove (does what is says on the tin) and woven into a detective yarn. Sadly, the illustrations which accompany this idea are far and away more interesting than the story, which is very superficial and ultimately fizzles out to nothing.<br /><br />All the characters are shallow. Some are nothing but crude outlines and the structure falls bizarrely apart in the final stretch when the narrator, who was part of the tale up to that point, abrubtly exits and is replaced by an unidentified other - i.e., author himself.  Although he talks about intertexuality and signs, Umberto Eco he is definitely not.<br /><br />In summary, this is an incompetent trashy novel with intellectual pretensions far beyond its ability. It pukes research notes, sometimes in great showy displays, as if this in itself somehow counted as substance - see p.86 - 87 for example, which nothing but a massive list of Dumas novels.  Alexandre might have been prolific, but he also had talent.",0

We bough used although there was only a couple of pounds difference and wish we hadn't, it's sticking, would send it back but not worth the hassle for the fact we only paid around 6 quid. Just bear this in mind when buying used, buy cheap buy twice it seems.",0

"I want to die .... having listened to Lana Del Rey I have never listened to such unbearable tripe in my life. Please, could someone stop this girl from making such droning \\""""music\\""""?<br />It's neither innovative nor speculative, but merely unadulterated awful.<br /><br />Personally, I always feel like I'm a nice, out-going cheerful type of person, but listening to Lana Del Rey makes all my happiness dissipate. I might be having my finest of days, the sun is shining and for once I feel like I'm happy. If a Lana Del Rey song  is played, I feel nothing but black clouds. I actually become angry hearing her voice.<br /><br />In an economic time when there is nothing to be happy about, why introduce songs which not only negate all happiness you were feeling before, but want to make you actually cut your own ears off so you don't have to listen to the droning anymore?<br /><br />I lost my right ear in a car crash 11 years ago. I'd actually go through it all again and again if it meant I didn't have to listen to this girl sing again.",0
"Great game but awful controls As a person who grew up with sonic classics like sonic the hedgehog 2 and the popular but controversial sonic CD seeing a new sonic game being released and in the fashion reminiscent of the classic old-school sonic the hedgehog games for the genesis really excited me. Now after playing both the pc version and the android version If you have a strong pc *or console for the matter* and have a solid game-pad to play on I would recommend going for that version rather the android one and I'll explain why taking into consideration its quality as a game and how well it works with android.<br /><br />Pros: It is the classic sonic we all remember back for a classy modern re-run how could anyone not resist the old meets new pre fifth generation juxtaposition. The graphics are great being colorful, vibrant and vivid and the high resolution means that the game remains unaffected by TV set up-scaling. Great gameplay nice integration of the new sonic homing attack. I enjoyed playing some of the classic style sonic 2 and 3 boss battles again just in hd.<br /><br />Cons: Controls are absolutely awful and unplayable on standard size android devices, to combat this I would recommend an external controller or gamepad device to play the game. Speed is ground down to a halt at times because of the broken hindering control scheme for android. No rotation of screen ability means that if your inbuilt speakers are placed on the side of the Android used for jump controls to hold the device and be anywhere near comfortable during play you'll effectively have to block the speakers and that's no good at all. The game does seem to lack a sense of speed in all versions that the good old genesis versions really excelled at. Not much for story but hey it's a sonic game.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed playing STH 4 till the annoying controls started to take its toll on my patience I would have rated it higher but this was such an issue that it rendered the game unplayable at times. If you've got a console or strong PC get one of those versions and if you don't get a gamepad to use with your android.",0

Book came in beautiful condition and 2 days before the estimated delivery Book came in beautiful condition and 2 days before the estimated delivery. The story line is fantastic. The TV series doesn't follow it exactly so you never know what's truly coming.,1
"Disappointing I really like&#34;Dollar&#34; so was very disappointed with the rest of this CD-it was very average at best.I hadnt heard any of the other tracks so knew it was a bit of a gamble.I bought Sam Smith at the same time,having only heard one track and I love that so you win some ,you lose some!!",0
amazing This app is amazing an  is so addictive. Once you've played once you keep on playing. This is a quite a hard game to play.,1
too cheesey My girlfriend wanted to see it. I fell asleep as I was so bored. She didn't enjoy it ever. Shame as the idea is a great one for a story but just wasn't good acting although  Neil Patrick Harris was good but play only a very short part.,0

"Not quite the ticket.. Firstly this book was ment to include a cd but it came without it.  I read this book, absorbing every detail, hoping it would help me perform a miracle, painless birth.. Sadly not the case!!  An interesting read with some uplifting stories but nothing more than that. I'm an open minded person but I think that sadly the authors of this book are cashing in on the 'fear' mothers have before birth.  I really hope it works for you, but it didn't for me!!",0
"Reference Material in all aspects The blu-ray album I bought can be seen over and over again.<br />Not only because of the extremely high quality of the music, the videoclips and, of course, the performance of miss Beyonce. The video- and audio-quality set truly new standards. Pin-sharp images, vivid colors and 360 degrees of clear sound and fantastic basstones (not too loud and too boomy).<br />This blu-ray album will be used by me in the coming perod as demo-material for my video- and audiophile friends.",1

"Missing Map The book itself is a great help when you feel a bit overwhelmed with the sheer size of the game, though it's size alone might add to that feeling at times!<br /><br />I'm a bit annoyed that the book says on the back of it there is a large poster map with roads on it which was missing from my supposedly good condition order. If a book is missing pages it wouldn't be considered to be in good condition would it?",0
please do not buy!!!!!! Do not buy this game. U might as well buy rio. Rio is so much better. They have tried to improve the graphics but have just made the gameplay slow and the map is so plain. It's just a load of shiny buildings. Buy rio!!!!!!! Not Vegas!!!!!!!!,0
"Poor quality, bad information I'm not entirely sure how this product has gotten such good reviews here. My experience with this book was more or less a disappointment. Start with the printing quality, which for such an expensive book is appalling. Half of the pages in my book have now become smudged and many of the words have become illegible. My main problem with it, however, is that I highly doubt the writers actually played much of the game they're pretending to know so much about. It seems that, instead, they more or less took Rockstar's word on how things SHOULD work, and then assumed that it's all working fine. So, for example, the book will happily tell you that the \\""""weed farm\\"""" random encounter is available to all three characters, and that it respawns once every week, whereas in fact this plainly not the case in the game. Many more such examples available. It gets to the point that you might find yourself wondering whether the authors have actually got the same game as you, or maybe whether they had access to some kind of special pre-release version where everything seemed to work just as it should.<br /><br />Not to mention, it tells you nothing of some of the most important things to know about the game, such as how to profit from the stock market, how GTA Online works, etc. In fact, its only real value is in providing you with maps for certain things such as weapons, armor, collectibles, etc. However, since those will soon be available for free (probably in much better quality) across many different sites on the Internet, then the book will be entirely redundant.<br /><br />So I would recommend you don't bother with this guide. Poor quality printing and plenty of factual errors and omission of important things make this a pretty bad product all in all.",0

"Odd... I saw that this book was coming out in the cinemas soon and I thought I might read it thinking it would be a good book but I was very much mistaken. First of all the main character (Charlie) is the most infuriating person I have had to read about in my life. I was half way through the book when I literally couldn't take Charlie's constant whining and crying any more yet somehow I couldn't put the book down. However annoying the main character was, the story was still a bit intriguing but it wasn't until the end that I finished the book and decided that this book is just PLAIN WEIRD and ODD! Worst of all, is that I still had no idea what Charlie was talking about in the end so therefore it wasn't till I looked the book up on Wiki that I finally understood the ending...not great!<br /><br />right well no I wouldn't recommend this book and I hated it.",0

"nice summer reading Did read it during summer trip in the Alps. No major surprises in the book, no 'big message', a bit repetitive now and then. However, book is full of short anecdotes that make it easy to read it, put it away for a day, read some more etc.<br /><br />The message in the book is probably not 'shocking' to someone with some background in the field, nor is it very scientific. Feels like Taleb tried to make a scientific book for the big mass, but failed at his attempt and got stock in between a little bit.",0
"Good, but should have been great. The marketing team behind One Republic were extremely shrewd choosing to release 'Stop and Stare' and 'Apologise' from the album. These are by far the most outstanding tracks on the CD, and i think it was fair to expect great things from this group. Unfortunately after a very promising start the songs sound uninspired and consequently none stand out, which is a shame because you certainly get the distinct impresssion this band are capable of great music, but for every 'All fall Down' and 'All we are' there are tracks like 'Tyrant' and 'Somethings not right here' which sounds like a bad pastiche of Jeff Buckley, wailing isn't singing and can be quite grating in the wrong arrangement. But there is enough to enjoy here, you just wish they managed to maintain their evident quality throughout instead of sporadically.",0
"not too great.. The YouTube searching and video variety itself is very good however, despite the fast streaming, there are constant advertisements popping up and clouding the screen and therefore you cannot watch it. I am not sure if it's just my kindle but I doubt it as when you try and get rid of them a new link to download the identical app appears but the only difference is you have to pay for it. Not pleaded.",0

"Where is Joe? There is no doubt that this is a very interesting and laid back compilation of cover versions and has great merit if you are looking to simply chill out. Beth Hart's voice is excellent and I will certainly be listening to more of her material so I suppose that it was worth buying the CD even for the introduction.  However, where is Joe?  Yes, there is a very decent guitarist accompanying Beth.........but not any better than some session musicians could. The Bonamassa uniqueness is not apparent and if I didn't know that it was Joe, well......  Still, overall, glad I bought.",0

"A sweet book, but expected more There has been a lot of buzz surrounding Wonder, especially lately as it was RHCP's book for Internation Book Giving Day. I thought it was about time I read it after having had it a while, expecting to completely fall in love with this story. However, although it was a really sweet story, I felt like I was missing something.<br /><br />Auggie has mandibulofacial dysostosis, a genetic condition that severely affects the face. In every other way, he's a normal boy, but people look and stare whenever he leaves the house. For his protection, his parents have home-schooled him, but now he's ten, they've decided the best thing for him is to go to a proper school. Narrated by him, his sister and his friends, we see his experiences, and the reactions of others; people being freaked out by his appearance, outright bullying, and people deciding that how he looks simply doesn't matter. Wonder is the story of Auggie's year at school.<br /><br />Wonder is a moving story, and seeing Auggie overcome his fears and start school, despite knowing how hard it's going to be is just so cool. He is such a strong little boy, and goes through so much hassle simply because of how he looks. Some of the things said and how he's sometimes treated are just heartbreaking. The adult edition of the book has Auggie wearing an astronauts helmet on the cover, and I always wondered why - because, for two years, Auggie would not leave the house without wearing it, because he couldn't stand the stares. It's so sad.<br /><br />It's also sad to read the parts narrated by his sister Via and his friend Jack. As Auggie's friend, Jack is a victim of bullying too, separately from Auggie, which is just awful. And yet, Jack is such a good guy, mostly. It would be so easy to stop it all, just by not hanging out with him anymore, but he sticks by his mate. Via loves her brother, but recently, she has been feeling a little resentful. She's just started high school, and has kept her brother's condition mostly to herself. She doesn't want to be the girl who's brother is deformed. She just wants to be Via. She no longer wants to be known for her brother, but for herself. And because her brother has needed a lot of special care, in and out of hospital, her parents focus a lot more on Auggie. Via has always accepted that this is the way things are, but now she's reached a point where it bothers her, and she would like some attention herself. She really does love Auggie, but now she's letting how she really feels come to the surface, and it's really sad.<br /><br />However, as sweet as the book was, I didn't love it. I almost felt like I was reading a different book from everyone else. Yes, I enjoyed it, I liked it, but I wasn't wowed by it like everyone else seems to be. Yeah, it was good, the ending was really great, and I'm sure it will be one of those really memorable books for me, but it didn't do all that much for me. I'm not completely heartless, I felt for Auggie, but to me it felt like there was something missing. There was so much potential for this to be an incredibly moving, beautiful story, but it didn't quite get there for me. It's a real unique story, I've not read anything like it before, but sadly, it did fall a little flat for me.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who have really loved Wonder though, so don't pass it by because of this review. It is worth a read, I did like it. It's just one of those cases where the hype made me expect a whole lot more. You might love it, though. Do give it a go.elf.

"Better than the 1st reboot - but not as good as 4th original The premise is laudable, and all concerned give it a good lustre, but this is soso hokum, not humdinging.<br />The drama never really gets beyond the CGI.

"Great translation. Surprisingly easy to read this well-known story in French! The translation is great and really helps illuminate the structure of the French whilst still remaining idiomatic.

"Cute This game is great for little kids because it takes a long time to finish it and it provides imagination and a variety of colour the only problem is that I think that all text should be spoken aswel as written, my reason for children who cannot read.

If you're a fan of the movies then this book will be hard to resist.<br /><br />You learn so much about the Corleone family that wasn't mentioned in the movies and the book also gives you some insight into a lot of other characters that are only mentioned or seen briefly in the movie.<br /><br />Easy five stars, great read.",1
"IS THIS THE BEETHOVEN CYCLE OF 2011,UNDECIDED Is it really the Beethoven cycle of 2011.I do not think so.It has any attractive packing and 1 DVD.The single DVD IS  more for the promotion of the DVD box set than the audio box set CD.The packing get 5 stars but what about the content,is mediocore chocholate in an expensive box set.With keep desire to hear THE cycle of 2011,I  was disappointed to say the least. Symphony 1 was slow to the point of being bore in comparison with other conductors.The sound is less  brillant than  Chailly version.Is that how Beethoven should sound or am I being brainwashed with conductors taking a faster speed.Even Mozart or Haydn is faster in thier symphonies.May I find a  a gem or Turkish delight  in his others symphonies but not in No2.Chailly version is  better in sound  and conducted than Thielemann.If am wrong, can some give me the reason why I should perserve with Thielemann version of the symphonies or recomend a version that this sonicaly more superior and conducted than Chailly.I would suggest any one completating  of buying ths set is to listen to it first.Do not view it in youtube,you will distracted with vision and pay less attention to the sound.I sincerely respect the reviewers who gave this version 5 stars. I  am not a musician or read music but in most cases the ears is better judge.The Bruckner symphonies diappointed when I bought it and sold it for 1/5 of the price that I paid.It might be labelled Beethoven cycle of 2011 but is far behind Karajan,Chaily,Colin Davis and others.Prospective buyers beware. If your are not conviced get it on Amazon with the option of returning it.I am waiting  the expert reviewers of Gramophone magazine (UK) and Fanfare(USA)",0

"Pleasantly surprised I enjoyed listening to the album, but then I am a Mark Knopfler fan of long standing, what I like about this is there are such variations in the style of the songs, you find it hard to slot it into one particular category, which is why I like it. To me music is to be enjoyed as it stands and not suddenly say it goes in this or that category. If I like something it's that simple, I don't say it belongs here or there, it jt is adds to the diversity of music I love, whatever it's genre. The one disappointment was that it came a day late on the 12th not the 11th as had been promised. Thus my reasoning for the 4 star rating, it's no reflection on the content.",1

"3 stars only. I await the hate. I seriously considered not posting a review of this product, as I'm all too aware that - because I had the audacity to not give it five stars - there's a distinct possibility that I'll be insulted, trolled, and probably hunted down and killed with sticks. You see, in my experience, and as a general rule, the people who like Firefly really, really, REALLY like it, and don't take kindly to anyone who doesn't feel the same.  So with that said, I'd like to make a couple of points clear before beginning my review.  Firstly, I 'get' Firefly, so please don't post patronising comments to suggest otherwise.  Secondly, I know the history of the show, and the cancellation of it, as well as anyone, and am not interesting in hearing the eight zillion reasons (read: excuses) why it flopped. I know all that.  Okay, the review:  Firefly tells the story of a ship's captain and crew, and the whacky adventures and scrapes they find themselves in. It melds the &#34;seemingly incompatible&#34; western and sci-fi genres, with varying degrees of effectiveness. (NOTE: &#34;seemingly incompatible?&#34; Really? Firefly cannot take the credit for this - the two genres are essentially one and the same, and anybody who tells you otherwise knows nothing about films and television.)  Anyhow: the scripts are taut and well-structured, and most episodes move along at a swift pace. The dialogue is sharp, but some of the one-liners feel forced.  The sets are excellent and the props range from 'outstanding' to 'that oxygen tube is clearly just a vacuum cleaner pipe'.  The main actors have good chemistry, but most of the characters are flat and unrealistic; there's the brute, the wisecracker, the worrier, the kooky one, etc. Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds is your basic Han Solo rip-off, only not as charismatic, funny or likeable. His character seems to ricochet from 'tortured war veteran' to 'gormless buffoon' with a complete absence of logic. Zoe, played by Gina Torres, is the weakest of all the leads,and may as well be called 'Generic Tough Chick A' for all the depth of character she displays. Then again, this is as much the writers' faults as hers. Plastic-faced Sean Maher plays the doctor, and seems out of place. Surely this guy belongs in Beverly Hills 90210? Alan Tudyk as 'Wash',  is excellent, and not only the best actor, but the strongest character in the show. An honourable mention should go to Adam Baldwin too; he usually plays 'stupid thug', but here he gets to play a stupid thug who says funny stuff. His is the most consistently entertaining character in the show. Ron Glass does credit to his role as Shepherd Book, and Jewel Staite is equally strong as Kaylee Frye, though her weird, piggy eyes do freak me out a bit. The bland Morena Baccarin adds nothing as Inara Serra - a 'companion' (whore) who seems just a tad judgemental for my taste, particularly for someone who earns her living on her back. She glides around, disapproving of everything and everyone, ever so slightly. For someone so technically attractive, Baccarin isn't remotely sexually alluring, so she's miscast here. Summer Glau rounds out the cast as the deranged River Tam, and does an admirable job here, considering it was her first big acting gig.  How did I feel about Firefly? I enjoyed it - often for the wrong reasons as well as the right - and don't feel that I wasted my money. It has a lot of positive qualities,  but isn't the seminal, unsung masterpiece that the OMG! OMG! OMG! THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!! brigade would have you believe. Nor is it &#34;the best sci-fi television show ever made&#34;, and to claim it as such actually does Firefly a disservice, because such a gushing statement does not come from objective appraisal, but from blinkered, zealotish fandom.  Whether or not you like Firefly may depend heavily on how much you like Joss Whedon as a writer. Personally, I don't care for him; I find his work cheesy and insubstantial, and his obsession with sexualising scarily young looking girls creeps me out. Plus, I'm still waiting for him to write a show for adults.  Perhaps Firefly came along five years too late. It was aired in an age when monsters like The Sopranos stalked the earth. People wanted intrigue, sex, violence - something cutting edge. Firefly simply couldn't compete.  Okay, I've dared disagree with the masses, so bring on the hate. . .or just give me negative votes anonymously because you know I'm right.  EDIT: Ha! That didn't take long. &#34;He's dared have an opinion of his own - down vote him!&#34;",0

"Instantly Forgettable and Rip-Off Vinyl in Cost and Vast Run Off Areas! I have been a Pink Floyd fan since I was 16 and all my Pink Floyd LPs are on vinyl and go back to Atom Heart Mother, Meddle, Umma Gumma, Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell, to name but a few of their great works. Endless River was pre-ordered and my wait was not rewarded as, at £26.00 for this so called 'Double Album', as soon as I opened the packaging and looked at the two discs I felt ripped off! At least 1/3 of each of the four sides is run-off, with no music! To put this in perspective each side has around four times the run off area of a normal record! I didn't have to play each side to realise I had been seriously ripped off, as the vinyl actually looks empty! I listened to all four sides in what seemed like the shortest time I have ever listened to a 'Double Album' and I have to say that what I heard was equally disappointing! The gatefold sleeve, when it opens out, shows Gilmore, Wright and Mason as a trio, in a large sitting room/recording studio, no doubt at one of their homes and as I listened, hoping that I would be pleased, I simply became bored and noted that the 'sitting room studio' really summed up the sound, the concept and the rip off! It is a cobbled together excuse and it is not not a good LP in any format and sadly in the vinyl format it is just a con!  It lacks any concept, has little depth or clarity and even with just one track with lyrics, the words are poor and really inadequate for a group of this calibre! We also have a reprise of the Steven Hawkins track from Wish You Were Here, but with little to improve on the original! I bought it thinking this would be a fitting tribute to Richard Wright and a farewell to a group that's past catalogue was exceptional, but this does not show Richard Wright's keyboard talents off at all and sadly even Gilmore's guitar and Mason's drums, are repetitive and kind of echos of other recent works. In fact, as I read the 'Wright' credits (and there are many) I was mindful of Gilmore's recent statement and obvious guilt, that he often over-looked Wright's contribution and talent. This LP suggests, to me at least, a guilt offering by Gilmore of Richard Wright's posthumous work, when, actually, it isn't very good anyway. It seems as though Gilmore and Mason have put together previously rejected material, as some sort of apology and all they have succeeded in doing is proving that Richard Wright, whilst an amazing keyboard player, was not a great writer. If this is the case, then there is an argument that it should have remained as 'out-tracks' as it wasn't fit for use when Wright was alive, so what on earth are they doing trying to convince us that it is any good now?! It isn't! It is a poor celebration of Wright and more of a release for Gilmore's guilt, which seems to have certain parallels with Sid Barret and the ''Wish You Were Here'' and 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond' release. The difference there was that even though Barret, who turned up at one of their recordings during the LP, was 'neglected', the LP was terrific.Endless River is not! It is instantly forgettable. It was best left in out-take heaven and Gilmore and Mason should not have conned a loyal fan base, with some guilt trip, especially with this vinyl exploitation!",0

"disappointing Managed 200 pages of this novel which jumped from year to year with no real fluency.  I could not become involved nor interested in the main characters and what the \\""""secret\\"""" might be. I was therefore happy to close the book having given it a good chance to awaken my interest, but I don't read to become bored. I enjoy family sagas, but there are a lot more worthy authors out there.",0
"Boring No,don't get this game! Its far from the PC version. After about 30 minutes I was bored.<br />1: There is hardly anything to build with,very limited number of materials.<br />2: No caves to explore<br />3: the world isn't infinte and pretty small<br />4: No multiplayer<br />Honestly,I can go on forever.<br />Uninstalling this and sticking to survival craft until this gets updated more. Updates take forever too.<br />r<br />Everyone should check out survival craft its not like all the other mine craft clones out there. It has pretty much everything the minecraft PC version has. Infinite worlds,caves,farming,breeding,horse riding,tons of stuff too mine and build with etc. And you can download texture packs in game and share and download other peoples creations its awesome.",0
Good album A few very good songs but not as fantastic as my daughter had me believe but on the whole a good album.,0
Great Game I really love this game play it every day and always run out of coins (don't like in app purchasing) who does but have seriously considered it for this game. It is pool easy to play hard to master always someone to play 24/7 would like the tournament's to be a little longer maybe best of 3 lost a tourney without ever taking a single shot that was a bit cold but then I also got the achievement deny completing a game without your opponent having a shot so swings and roundabouts I guess but if you like pool you will like this game easy controls I hope to see you on there soon.,1

"disappointing reissue Judas Priest were the 1st Heavy Metal band I got into at the tender age of 12 in 1978 and have been a fan ever since.I have never bought this album on CD before relying on my vinyl copy.But when I saw this advertised I decided maybe the time was right,especially seeing that a live DVD was with it too.Well it arrived today and all I can say is what a waste of an oppertunity.Firstly there is nothing wrong with the music that is 5 star and always will be,where this is let down is by the packageing.The booklet comes across as very rushed and cheap.Surely as a 30 year anniversary the band should have contributed with thoughts and insights into how this whole album came to be.The bit the band do contribute to is about the live dvd,which is very brief indeed,and there isnt even  lyrics.I would have thought a 30th anniversary reissue should have been on the scale of Megadeths Peace sells  box set,now that is how it should have been done.If you already have this on cd think twice about this purchase,mind you the lure of the Dvd might be too much to resist.So 5 stars for the music but only a 1 star for the packaging,what a waste.",0

"*spoiler alert* character development and traits missing. I understand that there are parts of the written story that wouldn't work on screen, but my opinion is that important parts of each character and their development were cut out just so the main focus was on the love story angle between tris and four. As I have read the books I was able to fill in the blanks, such as why Peter was not in the simulation when erudite used dauntless to kill the abnegation councillors. My boyfriend on the otherhand had not and I had to recall that peter was a psycho who stabbed another dauntless prospect in the eye as he was on the verge of being factionless as his score was to low and the importance of this boy showing up in the second book.<br />To me this is just one of the many 'little' incidental moments the have a meaning to later books.",0
"very depressing This is an awful book. The graphic descriptions of the rape went on far too long. There were pages and pages of every single graphic detail.

"Krystal is the character for me I will be honest I have never read a JKR book before. No -- I never got caught up in the hype of Harry Potter; mainly because I am not keen on fantasy. So it is with this book The Casual Vacancy that lead me to download it onto my kindle as it seemed far removed from Harry.<br />Set in an English village in the west country, Pagford, its the story of the have's and have nots. Characters grabbing at the chance to be elected as the next councillor on the parish after the sudden death of Barry Fairbrother.<br />It is very well written, in fact excellent in every way, BUT, it lacks PLOT. Ok there is a story, of course, but you are always expecting something really gritty to happen and it never really does. Which is a shame because the idea is so good and it has so much potential but doesn't seem to lead anywhere. The only character I really felt sorry for and really felt for her was Krystal. Krystal was born to doom to a junkie mother and saw nothing but abuse in her 16years of life. She desperately wanted to look after and protect her little brother, Robbie. She thought the only way to escape the Fields - an awful council estate - was to become pregnant and get her own place, that way she could look after her baby and Robbie. It really shows us what kind of world we live in because for all the Krystals' out there THIS is their reality. Her story I found so touching that this poor girl lived in a cesspit of Englishness that is shoved under the carpet and yet she sees it as the only way to survive  in her own little way. So sad!! Loads of Krystals' out there.<br />The book is grim with very little happiness. It may make a good tv series, as I have read it has been planned for this year, but it will be very bleak and grim.<br />I would definitely read another JKR book. Not sure if this has lead me on to Harry Potter though,  but you never know. Stranger things have happened.",0
"Heres the real story Plenty of funny reviews on here from all you cultureless kiddies about this most over-rated of bands - let me give you the truth.<br /><br />Theres always been talk of oasis ripping off the beatles and thats so laughably true - but what most people fail to notice is the plethora of other bands from that era who theyve robbed. everybody from T.rex to slade to Mott the hoople to the stones to the kinks (oh, sorry - that was blur) and many more besides. Oasis have built an entire career on 'borrowing' other bands riffs and melodies. they know it and i know it. What i hate about them the most however is that they fail to admit it and act like theyre so great when theyre not at all really. This album sums them up nicely. A selection of rip offs from start to finish, plageurising great bands from the past whose bootlaces theyre not fit to tie.<br /><br />And how did they get away with it? easy - they appealed to a generation of kids who were and are too cultureless and ill educated in musical history to see through them. The early 90's kids were the start of all the generations that have followed since who have reduced pop music to its lowest ebb ever and made the uk music scene the blandest and lamest its ever been<br /><br />oasis? you gotta be kidding me.",0

Now I have a guide for a game that doesn't exist, to make matters worse the book was slightly damaged and pages had what appeared to be water and heat damage. This was what I had noticed immediately after turning the hard cover, the guide came packaged well but appeared and its condition was not perfect.<br />It's in a useable condition, but I am annoyed with it being delivered separately, if I had to wait an extra couple of days...so be it...<br />But don't send damaged or not as described goods...<br /><br />The game I have cancelled and have decided to purchase through eBay (first class delivery) due to the frustration caused. DON'T TRUST AMAZONS PRE-ORDER!<br /><br />THE WORKERS ARE NOT TREATED VERY WELL EITHER!<br /><br />I have given a 3 star review purely because the guidebook is brilliant but due to damage and to the confusion in delivery and not receiving both when I had paid for grouped delivery I'm stopping at 3.<br /><br />Would have been an easy 5 star review",0

Five Stars Classic Reeves and swayze film,1
"It was ok,would recommend if anyone wanted a quick read. I bought this book because there was so much hype about the film coming out, that I wanted to read the book first.  The story started off well, I wanted to find out more about the intriguing Dexter and his nonchalant take on life. I must admit, I much preferred the student Emma to the 'adult' Emma.  I found that the pieces of Emma's life after university interrupted Dexter's story. I will propably be hated by die-hard fans of the book by saying that I was relieved with what happened to Emma in the final section of the book. I found that by the time Emma was in her 30s she was whiney, selfish and boring. At least the student Emma had some kind of save-the-world/finding herself personal purpose.  I struggled reading this book, mainly because Emma put me off. I never found the book really engaging, I never had that feeling of wanting to read just one more chapter to find out what happened next.   I can see why this bookis so popular. The story of the love of your life who got away, or left, or best friends who never went any further is one that can be seen around the world.  I am a 27year old housewife. Please don't judge me for not liking this book that much ;)",0

"Little magic, just warmed over Dawkins. There's certainly a market for a book that explores the beauty and wonder of the world for younger readers. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Most of what is said here has been said by Dawkins before (acceptable if he is anticipating a new, younger  readership) and said with the same appetite for mockery disguised as good humour (less so). Worse, it is repetitive in both format and content and, amazingly, rather dull in places.<br /><br />If this is meant to inspire an interest in science in young minds, those minds will have to be pretty darn uneducated to begin with. If the goal is to aid parents in introducing their kids to science then they'd be better off doing it themselves as opportunities present. Directing them to this book would likely defeat both the above objectives.",0

"Amadeus - The Director's Cut [Blu-ray] Saw this when it came out and once or twice since - all a long time ago. My recollection of a great film has not stood the test of time. This Blu-ray version does not look or sound better than can be had on ordinary DVD. But what really disappoints is the film itself. As critics have pointed out and I have come to realise (without giving too much away), the film does Salieri a great injustice: Salieri and Mozart were in fact good fiends and Salieri himself was by all accounts kind and generous. The film in this respect is definitely not 'based on fact'. Also, I find the heavy American accents of most of the actors extremely irritating - even the stalwart Brit actor Simon Callow speaks with an American accent!

"Disc 2 is good, disc 1 a waste of time Disc 2: Recently Sarah Kennedy on Radio 2 played \\""""I Believe In You\\"""" on her breakfast show.  After it was finished she sounded puzzled as she said, \\""""All she says is 'I believe in you' repeatedly over repetitive beats.\\""""    \\""""Kids\\"""" is also a very odd song.  The lyrics are random bits of meaningless phrases put together - it's almost avant-garde.  It's a triumph of studio production over songwriting.  My impression is that it was thrown together in the studio, and aggressively re-mixed until it sounded like a song.    The Nick Cave song at the end sounds very out of place.  It's probably one of the artistic highlight of Kylie's career.  For him it's just another track.      I'm not a conventional pop fan so my views are rather snobby.  If you've liked some of her songs on the radio then it's probably worth buying.  A lot of these are good songs.  They make a nice contrast to my usual more substantial music when I put my MP3 player on random/shuffle.    Disc 1:  It's of its time.  I listened to it once, and I doubt I'll ever listen to it again.  There are no hidden gems on this disc.",0

"It's who wrote the book and how the message is conveyed It was an odd experience reading some of the reviews in that there seemed to be a pride in announcing what a quick and easy read this book is. This should not be very surprising since the book is written in a slogan and advertising style with large writing and use of illustration. The book starts by trying to motivate the reader with powerful thoughts including those of a young lady who wanted to be as famous as \\""""persil automatic\\"""" which we can snigger at but cannot deny the outcome. What I found powerful is the bluntly stated graph of levels of success where you are invited to chose how successful you want to be. This for me a least, was a powerful invitation that felt like a decision at a crossroads, where once you chose that direction and stick to it you will arrive where you head for. The truth of this statement is a big commitment to personal responsability, not an easy decision. The book later becomes more about how Paul Arden made it in the advertising world. If you want to follow in his footsteps then a wider range of reading is required although here is as good a place as any. You need to be stand out and different, not a Paul Arden clone, so take a look at Brad Burton and Shed Simove as well as the big players in advertising.",0

"Daredevil-Theatrical Cut 5.5/10    First things first, whether or not you or I have read the Daredevil comic's is fairly irrelevant when judging the cinematic success or failure or yet another Marvel Superhero. As it stands we have Spider-man, Iron-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Punisher and then the likes of DC Hero's Batman and Superman. Having seen the big screen incarnations for all but two of these, I have to say Daredevil fares quite poorly. It's by no means a bad film, yet in watching it felt like there was half of a potentially excellent comic book film, and a half clichéd, unexciting story going nowhere. As most well already know Daredevil is really a man called Matt Murdock who suffered exposure from bio-hazardous material causing blindness, but also allowing him a heightened sense of smell, hearing, touch as well as making him super strong and perfectly balanced. Sound familiar? His father was a boxer and was killed early on in Mats life when he refused to throw a fight. Spurned on by this Matt has been fighting injustice ever since, helping those who can't defend themselves and so on. By day he's a respected lawyer fighting injustice alongside his best friend Franklin in Hells kitchen, by night he's Daredevil, crime fighter extraordinaire, well you get the idea. Murdock has all the stereotypical problems associated with most Super-Heroes, he is an emotionally conflicted man, unsure at times whether what he is doing is the right thing, often consulting a priest who watches over him despite apparently having little or no obvious connection to him. We learn Matt has been seeing a woman for three months who hasn't even seen his apartment; a quick and relatively easy way of establishing our boy is a lonely figure that can't juggle a romance and crime-fighting duties, a problem shared by aforementioned rival Superheroes. Despite this he does get a love-interest provided by Jennifer Garners Elektra Natchios a lethal martial arts expert, whose father is killed by Kingpin, and like Daredevil she vows revenge. They have a couple of touching scenes together and one short love scene that like most of the movie feels desperately rushed.    The rest of the players here are Jon Favreau portraying Mat's best friend and legal partner Franklin, he gets some good light humoured lines and his exchanges with Affleck are always fun to watch. Michael Clarke Duncan breathes great menace into Wilson Fisk also known as the Kingpin a criminal mastermind who Duncan brings a silently ferocious presence to; Kingpin is also responsible for the death of Daredevils father.   , a hit-man with a perfect aim played by Colin Farrell who probably had a lot of fun while playing this demented Irish assassin who is balls-out crazy killing people with peanuts, paper clips, death stars, daggers and overall is sadly under-used during the course of the movie. Joe Pantoliano, an extremely versatile actor who I really liked in \\""""The Matrix\\"""", \\""""Memento\\"""" and \\""""The Fugitive\\"""" plays Ben Urich (adding some form of emotional weight to what could have been an otherwise unmemorable character), a journalist who writes \\""""urban myth\\"""" related articles \\""""amongst other things\\"""" and is very close to uncovering the truth about Daredevil and the Kingpin. While I liked all of these characters and the actors playing them, it would have helped to have a bit more of Ben Urich or extended scenes between Matt Murdock and Elektra, even Mat's best friend and legal partner Franklin (whose scenes together I couldn't complain about) would have been nice to see a little more of. Instead what we get is a scattered collection of sketchily developed side players who actually appear to have more to contribute and I wish for the movie's sake they had been allowed to deliver more.      Along with the underdeveloped characters who, with a bit more screen time could really have helped the proceedings the first half of Daredevil suffers from a mix of frantic fight sequences, routine story set-ups that plague most comic-book movies and. The action sequences lack any of the fluidity or grace seen in either of the first two Spider-Man movies or Ang Lee's Hulk nor does Daredevil posses the clear high-octane sequences that set the latest Hulk alive. An early fight scene in a bar where our hero is tracking a known rapist is extremely difficult to make out because the scene is so dark and so shot so quickly. Also the effects are something of a letdown, watching Daredevil soar around the rooftops of hells kitchen never felt particularly believable, nor did the aforementioned fight scenes at the start, even some of the better material later on doesn't always hit the mark, an otherwise excellent battle between Daredevil and Bulls-Eye does at times appear fake. However around the halfway mark there's an injection of action scenes that were stylishly and effectively choreographed, involving, at various points Electra, Bulls-Eye and Daredevil. Also the assassination sequence and 90 per-cent of the final showdown make up for early problems I had with the movie's heavy action scenes.    However Daredevil isn't just about the action, while his back story feels almost fatally obligatory and is rushed through, the romantic aspects of the story involving Daredevil and Elektra are never really given enough time, Affleck and Garner have great chemistry on screen and while they're scenes are quite tender they feel a little bit rushed as a fair bit is crammed into a little over two hours, which is a shame given the story and its characters were worth fleshing out a little more, something apparently addressed in the 2005 directors cut. On that note I'll finish saying that if you liked any part of this movie and like me, and probably many others enjoyed part of this, I recommend the directors cut which got superior reviews and may deliver a fuller more satisfying version of Marvel's man without fear.",0

"Raising Steam Pratchett has lost none of his original flair and zest in this exhilerating trawl through all the old friends of the Ankh Morpurk series.  With its endearingly human central character Moist and the eccentricities of dwarves, trolls and a host of other characters, Pratchett guides us through an examination of change in its many guises, touching on seriously adult themes, such as racism, sexism and morality, while maintaining a continuously light-hearted tone of good humour and fun.<br />Vintage Pratchett!!",1

I don't think I can read any more, it is infantile, repetitive and I haven't even got to the spanking sessions yet. The overuse of the word \\""""Oh my\\"""" is quite frankly childish and extremely annoying.  I think I am going to have to pass on this and get back to reading some decent edge of the seat literature instead of this absolute twaddle. I'm just so glad that I didn't have to pay for it as I would be demanding a refund.

"Three Stars Few good tracks, but very slow",0
"Maybe I expected too much... I feel like only half the songs on the album are worth listening to. It's quite different from the full pop sound of Take That. This album is more raw. There is definitely a lot of meaning and heart in this album, but it only stands out on half the tracks. There are some gems on here: &#34;Face To Face (with Elton John)&#34; is a top quality pop song and is quite catchy. The lead single off the album, &#34;Let Me Go,&#34; took me a few listens to get into it, but now I really enjoy it. It's a great, up-tempo song with a different sound than we're used to hearing from Gary. &#34;Jump&#34; has got to be my favourite. Co-written with Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane, one of my dream songwriting collaborations produced a beautiful, deep piano song. Some of the other songs have deeper meanings and are more personal, but it doesn't translate into easily enjoyable music. I hate to say this, but &#34;Actress&#34; is absolute garbage. I was surprised, and not in a good way, when this song came on.<br /><br />The album is &#34;front-loaded.&#34; The best songs are in the beginning of the CD. It definitely takes a few listens to get into the songs individually, and the album as a whole. I don't think we've heard his best on here, which is what I thought we'd be getting.",0

Three Stars Very useful,0
"A bewildering work of staggering hubris This book comes freighted with great expectations -- although expectations of what, exactly, are unclear.  Is Dicker 'the next Stieg Larsson', or does the book pull off more literary feats, is it a &#34;Name of the Rose, for the 21st century?  Unfortunately, it is neither.<br /><br />You have to hand it to M. Dicker: he has chutzpah!  There are two books within this book, one written in the 1970s, a &#34;literary masterpiece&#34; that establishes the reputation of Harry Quebert, whilst the other  cements the young narrator's reputation at the &#34;literary forefront&#34; of his generation, and includes a plot twist that we are repeatedly told is &#34;genius&#34;.  And yet the extracts from Quebert's literary masterpiece are the worst writing in a book plagued by lazy writing, hilarious billets doux by an hysterical 15 year-old girl and her 30-something lover.  I swear, you will be quite unable to distinguish which is written by the ingenue and which by the literary superstar; it's also a curiously coy &#34;book&#34; that feels unlikely to have found critical acclaim at a time when &#34;literary&#34; American novelists (Updike, Cheever, Roth, Mailer) were dick-swinging their way around the American canon.  As for the &#34;genius&#34; twist, by the time you crawl, exhausted, to the final pages, there have been so many twists that it's really quite difficult to care (another problem being that the characters are really, by and large, not very likeable).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the plot has more holes than a proverbial Swiss cheese, and the dialogue is simply dire.  (The only attempt to render any sort of idiolect comes with the faux-phonetic transcription of the speech of a man badly disfigured by a beating; the results would be cringe-making were they not primarily so offensive.)  And here's the real rub: the book is set in New England, and therefore the text we are asked to read is supposedly the primary text, not a translation.  So much of this book simply does not read as if it's written by an American.  Even Quebert's surname (pronounced, we are told, &#34;Ku-bear&#34;) seems improbable (ditto Officer Gahalowood, with that curious extra syllable). The mother of Marcus Goldman (the narrator) is every sorry cliche of the &#34;Jewish mother&#34;, a caricature from 30 years ago, not three.  The book is casually misogynistic, curiously homophobic and stuck in some curious petit-bourgeois mindset.<br /><br />If you fall into that category of reader who thought Donna Tartt's &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; was dressed-up Harry Potter, then you really should stay away from this stinker!  The Tartt, at the very least, is written with care and wit and style.  No such respect for the reader here.  At the start of each chapter, Qubert offers Goldman a writer's tip, the very last one being, &#34;A good book is a book you are sorry to have finished.&#34;  Finishing TTATHQA I felt a mixture of relief, anger, bemusement... and joy that I can move on to a book that will almost certainly offer greater reading pleasures than this one did.",0

unreal and easily forgotten I really do not understand what all the fuss is about.  It's a superficial read. No depth and completely unrealistic.  The great escape plan?

"Another victim of the loudness war I haven't bought this myself but borrowed the 1976 album Arrival and it was obvious what had happened. &#34;When I kissed the teacher&#34; is a great sounding song with strong bass and powerful vocals: both the original vinyl pressing and the 1984 CD master share this feature. This was all gone here. The &#34;chesty&#34; vocals lost their impact and there was noticeable sibilance (a consequence of aggressive compression) and if I wasn't mistaken the bassline was not only hiding in the background (all the warmth had gone) but was clippy and distorted. I stopped there, the assault on my ears wasn't worth continued listening.<br /><br />The low price doesn't justify the poor sound quality. Indeed it may have been cheaper to collate the much better sounding 80's masters",0

I didnt identify with the characters since I never attended University and I generally do not warm to men who are 'players'.  Em seemed dull.  I tried to persevere but was still bored.  I flicked a few chapters ahead to see if it was any more interesting and found it wasnt, repeated this a few times and it never got any better.  I am slightly disappointed but then don't feel like I'm missing much.  I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about with this book and now the film is coming out I am not even slightly tempted to watch it.",0

This film was made for the BBC.  This black and white film manages to capture the charismatic quality of Rossetti, the eccentricity of Swinburne, Siddal's ethereal beauty (and working-class practicality).

"Phil Collins - Ain't nothing like the real thing Oh dear. I am sure that Phil Collins deeply loves this music and to be fair he makes a decent fist of &#34;Papa was a rolling stone&#34; and &#34;Uptight (Everything's alright)&#34;. He also frankly admits that this was a labour and love and as such &#34;my idea...was not to bring anything 'new' to these already great records&#34;. The trouble with this statement it that it begs the question why record them at all or more importantly what additional dimension is the selling point for this? Doing an X factor style run through of these great songs as an exercise in reverence is laudable but as a scintillating piece of music it falls flat. Carole King's &#34;Going back&#34; has been better covered by other artists not least of all the lovely versions by Dusty Springfield and Nils Lofgren. &#34;Heatwave&#34; always sounded perfect when performed by the Motown female groups like Martha and the Vandellas or the Supremes, thus Collins is onto a hiding to nothing here. His cover of &#34;Jimmy Mack&#34; is truly excruciating (although not as bad as &#34;You keep me hangin on&#34; on the deluxe edition), while &#34;Going to a Go Go&#34; is so intrinsically associated with Smokey Robinson and the Miracles that any artist would be brave to cover it and Collins voice is just not up to this. Thus for anyone to fall deeply in love with this album they must already be deeply in love with Collins voice since he admits that these are ultra straight recreations of the originals and while the backing musicians playing may be impeccable the &#34;shop window&#34; is Collins himself. The previous recent take by a white singer on the Motown catalogue by Michael McDonald kind of worked (although not always) but that was fundamentally because the former Doobie Brother does sound like a black singer, with Collins you keep expecting him to break into &#34;Abacab&#34; at any minute.<br /><br />Having listened to Phil Collins take on the work on these classics of Motown I would remind the new or discerning listeners that Motown Chartbusters Vol 3 remains available on Amazon for under four quid where this transcendent music can be heard in its glory, as vibrant today as it was in the Sixties. If you don't own the originals seek them out and get the most sublime pop music of the 20th century to rank with the Beatles. Finally while I am not overly fond of Brian Wilson's recent covers album of Gershwin songs to his credit he tries something different, alternatively Robert Plant presents a model for older artists to aspire to with his brilliant choice of music for &#34;Band of Joy&#34;. At one time Collins produced an album with his jazz fusion group Brand X called &#34;Unorthodox Behaviour&#34; which actually rivalled Weather Report in its brilliance (more please) in contrast &#34;Going back&#34; stands as an exercise in treading water by a very likeable bloke, but in the words of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell it &#34;ain't nothing like the real thing&#34;.discerning listeners that Motown Chartbusters Vol 3 remains available on Amazon for under four quid where this transcendent music can be heard in its glory, as vibrant today as it was in the Sixties.

"Loved it First of all: What a cute cover!!!<br /><br />You just gotta love Lara. At first she is sad and unsure. She had her heart broken and her great aunt Sadie died. Then Lara thinks she must be dreaming, when she sees a younger version of her great aunt as a ghost. This ghost wants her necklace and Lara has to stop the funeral. She tells everyone that she thinks that Sadie was murdered and has to go to the police. Sadie is there every step oft he way and Lara tries to find out where the necklace is, which turns out to be very hard.<br />The converstation between Lara and Sadie seem very real through the writing and it’s funny to see how Lara acts in front of everybody.<br /><br />Through her work Lara discovers that Sadie is a big help. She can just go anywhere and spy. She helps Lara with that. So Lara wants her to spy on her ex-boyfriend. Sadie can even make him think that he still loves her and they get back together again.<br />Also Sadie has laid her eyes on a guy, she found him in an office. Now she wants Lara to go out with him. In an embarrassing moment Lara asks him out in front of his colleagues, and he says yes. Lara thinks that he is never going to call her, but then he does (Sadie convinced him). The situation couldn’t get funnier and more complicated. I really enjoyed that, because it made the story more interesting and alive.<br /><br />Sadie is a girl from the Twenties, so she wants Lara to wear clothes from the 20ies. Lara doesn’t feel comfortable, but she decides to do it anyway, it’s just one date right? Well, she thought wrong, Ed invites her to a Business Dinner where Lara uses her „magic powers“ (Sadie) and entertains the people. Lara knows, that Ed is American and didn’t see anything of London yet. They agree on a sight seeing tour, where Lara shows him the city. In the meantime she is still figuring out where the necklace is and she breaks up with Josh. He wasn’t right for anyway. Well, at least that was my feeling.<br /><br />Forthe sight seeing Lara takes Ed tot he Tower of London first. They talk a lot and seem to be having fun. Their chemistry is growing and growing. Then they go on onto the London Eye.  That’s where it happens, finally: They kiss. BUT, Sadie sees it, so Lara is confused and tells Ed that she needs to sort out things first. I finally thought YES, they made it, but …<br /><br />I felt so sad for the two of them, because they’re perfect together!!!<br />Of course Sadie is upset and Lara has no success speaking to her. So she tries to find out more about Sadie’s past and suddenly she gets closer to the truth.<br />A week after their unfortunate date, Lara hears twenties music: the festival (Ed and her got tickets for that). Maybe that’s where Sadie is and so Lara goes there and there she is. Sadie still refuses to talk. Not only Sadie is there, but also Ed, more gorgeous than ever. They talk and Sadies tries to convince him to leave. However Ed doesn’t listen to her and he kisses Lara. That’s where their future started and then Lara tells him about her great aunt Sadie and the necklace. She shows him something and Sadie follows them and is surprised of the reveal...<br /><br />Such a funny and romantic story, with lots of great moments and chemistry.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5",1

I guess if you have visited or live in the region the book was set it may be be more interesting to hear the description of the location but personally I found it tedious and didn't really add to the story.<br /><br />Character development was ok - patchy in places but ok.<br /><br />Will I read the following two books....i'm not sure....,0
Recipes for Home Cooking This recipe book includes some good recipes.  Some require a few more unusual ingredients than usual home cooking.  Nice to have different ideas.,0
Three Stars Excellent game,0
really good. I think it is really good I think you should get this game and great for kids<br />😀😀 and fantastic for free.it is really fun for adults and kids 😅  😅.,1
"Evil?no,not really.Dead?no,not really! Remake?reeboot?who cares?its that time again to get a bunch of unknowns and remake a classic.Take away all the elements that made the origanal such fun and this is what you get.A humourless,rushed and annoying case of couldve been something great but isnt.Dont be fooled by the trailer for the film!!!there is no chainsaw action,no were gonna get you song and alot of scenes darkened and shortend than promlsed.im not saying its awful.im saying,like a beady eye albulm, why bother.",0
"I love love love this book!! I have completely fallen in love with this book, I struggle to find a storyline that isn't completely predictable and Leaving Time shocked me so much that I was left open mouthed. It also broke my heart a little.<br />Jodi Picoult gives each of the main characters their own chapters allowing us to see the events unfold from different perspectives which was brilliant when reaching the climax of the book as it didn't reveal the twist in its entirety until each character had 'spoken' which meant as a reader you can piece together the events as the truth unfolds.<br />The novel includes romance, adultery (without being explicit), paranormal activity(in a mature way), family bonds, and how humans & elephants cope when those bonds are broken somehow.<br />The story includes moments of heart break and is definitely a tear jerker. After reading this book you'll just have to sit for a few minutes and really think about what you've just read.<br /><br />So happy I purchased this. Honestly one of the best books I have ever read.",1
??? I don't get it.,0
getting it on I'm rating 1 Star because every time I go of it and go back on it keeps saying connecting to service and it always restarts the game,0
"Film - Fair, DVD playback - utter tosh! I watched this at the weekend, having seen it previously at the cinema. I say I watched it at the weekend, I didn't we turned it off because of the very poor quality of the DVD playback. Pixilation galore. At first I thought it might settle down or my eyes would grow used to it, but it seriously is that bad.     Is it;    A) Just a poor copy.  B) Overloading the disc with too much data  C) Take answer B) & add; a cynical attempt to get everyone to start buying Blu Ray only for new releases    When the price of Blu Ray falls into the current DVD price bandings I will consider it, but as that will mean two Blu Ray players for two rooms to make the format flexible for home viewing I'm in no rush. No matter how hard they push the product.     I mean, who is really going to fork out for the Blu Ray/DVD combi pack every time something comes out? Not old tight wad me I can tell you.    Another thing why can't I copy films to digital formats like I can music CD's (allegedly I may be aware of this).     Another rip off, buy it not once on DVD, get it again on Blu Ray & then purchase it for your portable player, for films on the go! Are you having a laugh?    Free digital copy - Now that is an offer worth taking up, making the purchase cost effective, but sadly there is so little choice.     Passionate about film, passionate about pricing!",0
"OH no I used to like gaga but this album is truly awful. I am a Madonna fan but am not so shallow as to get involved in all the rubbish that fans get involved in but on the song fashion it is a complete and utter rip off of holiday, it is so blatant we actually started laughing when we heard it. She is better then this but she had become a parody of herself.<br /><br />There are a couple of mediocre tracks but the rest is a complete mess, musically it is all over the place, vocally it is poor but production is good.<br /><br />Lady gaga do yourself a favour and disappear for a while, write some decent material which we all know you can do and stop getting in the paps every day dressed up as sponges etc!!!<br /><br />I am taking this cd back it is so bad and I am really disappointed in this half hearted attempt. if you want to survive in the fickle music industry you need to produce better or you will disappear in the tirade of good female performers and please stop with ripping Madonna off, having influences is good but if you are continually seen and heard ripping her off you will become nothing more than a tribute act.",0
Four Stars Good said wife,1
"59'Sound? There are a few outstanding tracks on this album.  The rest of the songs are of a good standard, making this an altogether very listenable album.  There is really nothing bad to say.  I would recomend that you buy it.  But that's it.  There is nothing groundbreaking or any real sparks of genius here.  It's just good time roll n rock.  The story telling is good, with extra cheesy lyrics chucked in for good measure.  I imagine this disc will stand the test of time, that's always a good thing.",0
Great Great graphics and lots of time to solve puzzles,1
Five Stars Epic !,1
"all fillers no thrillers Based on the current two chart songs (Boom Boom Pow and I gotta feeling)I bought BEP's latest album, hoping to find similar quality. No such luck -the other 14 songs are fillers, as you find so often these days buying albums. I wish I spent my money on singles downloads - not on this album.    the END",0

A Better Film than Book I much preferred the film to the book in this case and would advise everyone not to bother with the book but to rent the DVD instead.<br /><br />It is what it is - but the writing style is pretentious and bloated.<br /><br />It makes a great movie though!,0

Get the egg: Foosball pro This game was okay to play and you need two players. Sometimes the game glitches but it is usually fine . After a while it can get a bit boring and you just tend to give up so be prepared not to be really excited by this game.,0
"So-so demolition of an easy target If you're religious you may not like this review. Chances are you won't ike the book either. Better stick with self-help books and a nice cup of tea.  The usual offering from Richard Dawkins, who once again logically thrashes the infantile rhetoric and platitudinous sputum offered by religion and it's advocates. Still, I can't help but feel it's flawed in some important way - perhaps the way he characterises religion in simplistic terms to support his thesis. But then again, religion *is* pretty dumb... And I can't find any logical errors per se in what he argues.",0

and while I liked their singing in BGT I too was disappointed with ... Hey you guys I paid $34.95 In Australia to get it through my local music store; and while I liked their singing in BGT I too was disappointed with the quality of the product.  Done too quickly to make a buck!!,0
Three Stars Was okay if you like the other you will like this,0
Book chosen for me to read for a local book club Not my sort of book but good to read something not of your own choice.  I got rather bored readit it.,0
"Disappointment? The seventh and last chapter \\""""The Deathly Hallows\\"""" is an exciting book but I went through it with mixed feelings. I wanted to know what would happen in the end but I was frightened about a sad ending, too. I didn`t expect that Harry Potter would die but I was so shocked about Dumbledore's death that I suspected there would be  another death.<br />The book started excitingly but in the following paragraphs it was hard for me to read on. People who have read that book to would possibly know what I mean. The time passed on very slowly and it threatened to become a bit boring. After some weeks I took the book up again. It was just one page later that the next thrilling scene came. The whole book took me into different senses. I was sad, disappointed and totally carried along. To be honest it wasn`t the best book in the series of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. I rushed through the earlier books, while this one took more time. For me this has to be the last book about Harry Potter because I don't believe that any further books would reach the high quality that has been achieved in the first six books.<br />In my opinion the ending isn`t very good. It is boring and does not satisfy me. I get to know things which I don't want to know but I don't get to know things in which I'm really interested. To conclude, I liked that book but it wasn't the best book I`ve ever read.",0

"my first purchase at amazon, not fully satisfied. Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister are both excellent series, and even a re-run is as hilarious as the first viewing. however, the quality of the DVD is not satisfactory. the series 1 of the yes minister had a very poor sound quality. as the sound was poor i switched on the subtitles and regretfully even the subtitles- not sure if its the BBC who did it- are deplorable. i am now in the second series, and here the sound is a shade better.",0

"Good... But not THAT good I read this book without watching the movie, but intending to do so. And completely unintentionally I read it all in one day. I found the book good, I'd even say engrossing given that I finished it so soon, and I really identified with the character of Emma (right down to the mild obsession with the term bluestocking), however there was something lacking... So much so that the 'emotional ending' that seems to leave everyone in tears didn't affect me at all. It was unexpected, but it really didn't move me. And this is coming from a girl who has recently cried at an advert because it hit a nerve...  So without all the hype I'd happily have said this was a four. But so many people think it's wonderful, and I really didn't think it was all that.",0

"REALLY??? THIS IS WHAT PASSES AS ART TODAY??? Any writer who needs to fill up pages with over five hundred F-Bombs, (what they used to call cursing or swearing or using profanity back in the day when writers didn't need to use such things to get by), is not what I want to use my time watching.<br />Any actor or actors who needs to fill the screen with their naked body parts to pass it off as some sort of new on the edge acting style or statement is not the actor or the images I want to be poured into my mind via my eyes by way of the big screen.<br /> And any director who needs to constantly shock shock shock one movie after another over substance and interesting narrative is not one I want to waste any more time on - I have already wasted enough time and money on Marty over the years.<br />Last note: at least when Marty had Bob in his corner the flaws in his direction and narrative could be overlooked because we had an artist who could actually inhabit the role to the point one completely forgot any acting was taking place; with Leo you can see the cogs and wheels creaking and grinding around; one is very much aware that we are watching someone who is &#34;acting&#34; a role instead of inhabiting that role.<br />No more Marty pictures for me.<br />Enough profanity is enough profanity already and leaving nothing to my imagination is just too much of an insult to me to have to put up with any more.<br />I only gave this one star because Amazon will not allow a reviewer to give no stars; but that is my rating, 0/5.<br />And that is being generous...<br />Shalom.",0

"Old crowd to make an old sound British Prog-rock for sure, following in the steps of all the greats, Genisis, Tull, Barclay James Harvest etc. This is not to mean more of the same, but come on guys has this not been done to death already. Certainly it does not fall short of good, if not great songs, but has a slight style of its own. If you have never grown out of that period of rocks history, then this will give you something new to think music of this gender has still more to say.<br /><br />There is plenty of great musicianship found within this release that can help you digest the content easier. The whole album flows with confidence in the certainty of coming to its conclusion. I do like this but find it does grind on the past too much to entertain one. Just to point to this fact is the people involved are from said times, such as Theers Van Leer, Steve Hackett and the like. All the songs go on forever as is the like of this music, the only added benefit is the music is a little more folk influenced and gentle.",0
Wonderful read Fabulously written book comes with can't put it down till it's finished cliche. I don't want to spoil it by giving it a description yet equally I want to give the book the recognition it deserves . So I guess the only thing I can say is go and buy it :-),1

By the lyrics on some of the tracks it's more \\""""Take The P*ss\\"""" rather than \\""""Take The Crown\\""""!! This album rates as poor as Rudebox. For such an entertainer and someone with the ability to put out some great songs, certainly from his earlier albums, why does he feel the need to swear and even write such a poor song as track 5. \\""""S*** on The Radio\\""""!    Robbie, retire now if this is the best you have left!!    Save your money and listen to his earlier albums when he was on form!!!",0

"Let down by Cowell Well, Simon Cowell does it again.  Just as his production company has buried Leona Lewis's wonderful voice under layers of excessive orchestration and poorly balanced dynamics, so they have managed to swamp Susan Boyle's big, rich voice in orchestration far too loud and heavy to do her justice.  You'd have to work really hard to make Ms Boyle sound tinny;  but Cowell's production team manages it ruthlessly on this CD!    Cowell's firm does seem to go in for gilding lilies and adding syrup to fresh mangoes.  Ms Boyle and Ms Lewis both have powerful voices with big ranges of pitch and dynamics.  But Cowell embeds them in florid and heavy settings that rob these gems of all their brilliance and richness;  and that, of course, makes the settings themselves appear tawdry and tasteless.    This CD leaves one feeling sorry for Ms Boyle, whom it lets down so badly, and sad for the lack of what was so wonderfully promised by her powerful and moving performance of 'I Dreamed a Dream' on the X factor.  Who did the orchestration and production then?  That showed her voice off so well!  Cowell should think of employing those guys:  they were more interested in presenting the performer and the song than parading themselves.",0

"Long live TAAB 1. The old expression is 'if it 'aint bust don't fix it' - in my opinion this certainly applies to TAAB 2. The 1972 and first version released by Jethro Tull is far superior. However, this version has never been performed in its entirety. Anderson promises to tour with the second version with his 'new' band - messrs O'Hara, Goodier, Opahle and Hammond. The DVD shows how frustrated Anderson becomes when the new boys cannot master his demands. So why bother? - he cannot need the money. if you are a dedicated Tull fan who has followed their music since the creation, pass on this edition - put on TAAB 1 and listen to class.",0

"Not as good as the first The first album was a lot better than this one. This one is mediocre as described in another review. I listened to this one over and over to try to find a great song, but could not. Of course the beats and general song structures are good as should be expected, however there is a real lack of great guitar work. It seems that Joe Satriani has orders to keep things toned down so that Sammy can dominate. I suppose the fan base of Chickenfoot would be quite varied and some will prefer this album as it features more vocals and less guitar. The guitarists and guitar lovers will definitely be dissapointed. I could not find one song that I think is really cool for guitar. Maybe when they do the songs live there will be some lead breaks and Joe will be able to let loose.",0

"Have a bucket ready I'v always loved celtic music having followed the likes of Clannad for many years and I thought I would take a gander at this as some of their songs are covered on this disc.Celtic music? Ok I thought..I like that.Slain Castle...good location for said celtic music.But ohhhh.....how disappointed I am! The girls are clearly miming to the songs and theres absolutly no life or soul to this concert.I should imagine by the end of this the girls faces must had been stuck in a smiling position as thats all they do thru out,smile..smile...smile.The whole thing reminded me of Steps in concert but a lot lot worse,I suppose this is somebodys cup of tea but I'm sure real celtic music performed live should have much much more get and go about it.After 5 songs I'd had enough.Why don't Clannad release a dvd..please!!!!!

I have tried listening to this several times, sober and not sober and there's nothing that sparkles. I really wish I could say something better about it. It really isn't worth the money. I wouldn't dream of downloading music as artists who produce the sounds which enhance my life should be supported. However for any future release from Fourtet I will definitely be listening on YouTube before I buy as I no longer trust him to deliver the goods.

"great music, but a little too clinical I'm afraid I can't get as excited as most people about this, although it does contain some beautiful music, brilliantly played. It just sounds a bit cold and clinical to me, and it sounds as though they're playing about half a mile from the audience. Maybe it's just me, but I feel the best live albums draw you in and if you shut your eyes, make you feel part of it. This one, frustratingly never quite achieves that somehow.",1

"The best Grunge album ever released! Its Nirvana. On September 24, 1991, Nirvana released what is in my opinion one of the, if not the best grunge album ever released. Every single track on this album could stand on its own and I would still pay the full asking price of the entire album, it's that good. What makes the album so good is both the phenomenal music but also the mastering on the album, this is definitely an album to get on CD as opposed to a compressed MP3 file! Every single song is great on this album and I highly recommend it to any self respecting rock or grunge fan!",1

"okay This game is okay, however I became bored very quickly. It's okay for passing the time but basically the game consists of shooting coloured balls at other coloured balls. I got this app as a free app of the day and I definitely don't think it is worth paying &pound;1.27  for. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you find pleasure in repetetive wastes of money and time.",0
"Abysmal - avoid at all costs The only reason I gave this adaptation one star is that you can't give none. The book has been butchered, leaving out several important scenes -for example in the book, when Mr Rochester's brother in law turns up he says to Jane that he wishes he could be somewhere with only her for company. Leaving these vital scenes out means that there's no sense of their falling in love, and like other reviewers have said, Rochester's proposal is completely unexpected. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Jane with no emotion whatsoever, Zeffirelli could have cast a plank of wood as Jane and got just as much emotion from the character. I found it impossible to sympathise with the character and found it difficult to believe that this jane could feel anything at all, let alone the intense love that she feels in the book. I was astonished to see so many positive reviews, I nearly felt traumatised after seeing this adaptation at the act of butchery on such a great book",0
Amazing I thought this game would be really boring but it is extremely addictive and fun to play. It is quite easy and uses a lot of modern references like facebook and angry birds,1
"alright I love this book, however once reading it again you do begin to realise she didn't commit shicide over something very serious.

"Has anyone had the same problem as me Has anyone had the same problem as me. When i recieved this i tried to take the record out only to discover the inner sleeve got stuck inside the cover as it appeared to have been placed there before the adheasive holding the outer cover had time to dry. I managed to pull the record out and found a lot of adhesive stuck to the outer rim of the record itself. I ordered a replacement which i recieved within twelve hours (thanks Amazon) and the same thing again, only this time the adhesive only caught on the edge of the inner sleeve. So this time i was able to play the record. I am not impressed the quality as it was like listening to an old 78rpm. The cover won't fit properly in a PVC gatefold protective sleeve as the cover was manufactured too big for one. I would have expected the Music On Vinyl people to have made this as there previous productions of Bowie records were fantastic. I am a big Bowie fan but i'm dissapointed i paid nearly £40 for something I won't bother playing as i have it on CD.",0

Before i start i would like to mention i am a heavy user of plex on ios which i use to air play to play my media on to an apple tv (which worked most of the time) my main reason for purchasing a fire tv was for the shear reason of having all my media on my tv so me and my family wouldnt have to gather round a phone trying to find something to watch!<br /><br />When initially seeing the app being free on the market place i was over the moon with joy but apon further inspection i was left dispointed having to pay £3.29 for something that may not work and not going to end up keeping... which was exactly what happened. The video feed constantly freezes when playing back media (no real surprise really plex is always buggy af anyway) i spent a good half an hour toggling all the setting but it was no good, packaged up my fire tv really disappointed and annoyed for one paying £3.29 for this useless application as well as the £4 shipping to send the f-ing unit back.<br /><br />DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!<br /><br />If your going to charge 3.29 for an application i expect it to work, sort it out!",0

"Not up to expectations at all. After all the rave reviews I was really disappointed in this book.  Both the main characters were extremely annoying and I really didn't care what happened to them as neither were likeable and both dull in their very different ways. I found their inability to change what happened in their own lives very frustrating.  The story tried to move but I didn't feel really got anywhere.  I read it to the end hoping it would get better and while the last couple of chapters did improve, overall it was pretty boring.  Some other people I've spoken to really liked it, even though they agreed with my opinion of the characters.",0

"telepathic chemistry Now a couple of years have gone by it's much easier to get a grip on this sprawling 3 cd collection. All the people that reviewed it after 5 minutes and gave it 'average' 3/5 marks.... it was a bit daft to do that. I've been listening to this set a lot lately and all of it is pretty incredible. Even some of the looser tracks, the fragments and the embryonic birth of well known pieces... all sound fantastic to me.... 2 years on.<br />Can were certainly at their best when tempered by the razor blade of the ever watchful Holger who knew how to create concise almost-pop out of sprawling jams. There will be no more moments like Spoon, Vitamin C, Moonshake or Sing Swan Song again as bands just don't work like that anymore. Even Can after the golden years 69-74 started multi-tracking and therefore losing the special telepathic chemistry between the musicians.<br />So - not for Can beginners certainly. But for fanatics, the curious, the students and the collectors this set is a 'must'.",1

"This was not what I expected - just a boring cookbook with random stories here and there I was very excited about this book as it was supposed to be about learning. I have never been very good at cooking so I thought this would be a good time to learn something about that too.<br /><br />The learning bits are interesting but very short and random. The whole book is very disorganized and full of random info on this and that. This is not really a book about learning, it's just like any other cooking book with very random stuff here and there.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing is probably that this was supposed to be a cook book that doesn't require you to buy a lot of new stuff to start cooking, and the recipes were supposed to be simple and easy to follow. I have a fairly well equipped kitchen and a very large grocery store nearby but this book is full of kitchen stuff that I don't own (and that are very expensive to acquire) and the recipes are full of ingredients that I can not buy anywhere that I know. So after I realized that and skipped the cooking parts, I didn't really find any good or useful info about learning in this book at all.<br /><br />Oh and about the UK edition.. The only difference to the US edition seems to be that the book is not a hard cover. I don't see how that makes it a UK edition.<br /><br />I have been an avid reader and follower of Tim's blog and videos since 2007 and I really liked especially 4HB, and will be reading his blog in the future too, but this book was quite disappointing.",0

"The first film was bad, this one almost makes it look fairly good Do you have to be a woman to enjoy this BJ stuff? Am I alone in thinking it appallingly self indulgent and exclusive? I hated the first film, and this one I just felt sorry for. Weak beyond words, it was structurally terrible, even though the story called for her to be holed up in Bangcock - was it necessary to let the film just flap around as the sappy female 'entertained' us with her impressions of Madonna (I'm not calling her Madge, she's as awful as BJ). Badly scripted, highly predictable and very very boring, full of one dimensional cardboard characters and a very narrow presentation of England. Based on a literary model of dubious quality, either of the movies were going to struggle to be worth watching.",0

"Unconvincing ending which ruins the book (SPOILER ALERT) WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br /><br />Please do not continue to read this review if you wish to read the book as it contains spoilers.<br /><br />This book is an easy, entertaining read and keeps you interested until the end, although personally I didn't ever feel that the characters were facing any real imminent danger. It is full of suspense but not really a thriller in my estimation. A number of reviewers have said that the main characters were all unlikeable, but I have to disagree in regard to Rachel who is the main protagonist in this novel and an alcoholic. Yes, she has flaws but I thought the author did quite a convincing job in her portrayal of alcoholism and its effects, including the episodes of memory loss which is crucial to the plot. I felt sympathy for Rachel and believed she was well-intentioned.<br /><br />By the end of the book you begin to realise there are deeper psychological issues and can understand why Rachel became depressed while married to Tom. You begin to see the same patterns emerging in Anna's life and it makes you wonder what kind of life Rachel could have had, had she not met Tom. The dynamics of the relationships between these characters become clearer when you discover how each of the characters' opinions of each other are being influenced.<br /><br />The only person I fail to understand is Tom, and there lies the problem.<br /><br />I don't understand why Rachel still harboured feelings for him, when deep down she must have known. If there had been a reference to some of Rachel's memories being deliberately suppressed, then this would make more sense. Anna's actions at the end of the novel are not plausible, and her feelings towards Tom seem to flip in an unrealistically short amount of time. Anna's hatred towards Rachel was also still very much in evidence despite the revelations, so why did she choose to become complicit in the murder when she could have passively pinned the whole thing on Rachel by taking no action at all? Anna's whole life had unravelled by this point and she will have to live with the guilt forever, but she walks away from it all seemingly unscathed. So we have Rachel who has suffered terrible abuse but she has a harder time letting go of Tom than Anna who was relatively well-treated.<br /><br />We were also told that Megan's affair with Tom dated back to September 2012 (on discovery of the text messages). Yet, as late as 25th September 2012, Megan was being ignored by Tom, found it awkward when she bumped into him or Anna, was actively avoiding them and was wishing they would move; then out of nowhere and with no explanation at all we are expected to believe that they started planning an affair within 5 days.<br /><br />By the end of the book, the early compliments on the character portrayal for Rachel are replaced by niggling doubts. Was she a victim of manipulation or did she really go off the rails when under the influence of alcohol? The reasons for her dismissal from the company she worked for and the nasty email sent to Tom would still suggest the latter. What reason is there to find her recollections at the end of the novel more reliable than those that preceded it? Again, we come back to the unfathomable Tom who manages to transform into the archetypal villian at the plot's convenience for a Scooby Doo style ending.<br /><br />For a book with a fair amount of superfluous exposition (albeit descriptive and interesting while you think it's all leading somewhere important), there are an unreasonable number of fatal plot holes which provides for an unconvincing ending.oint and she will have to live with the guilt forever, but she walks away from it all seemingly unscathed.

"An Excellent Film &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; is regarded by many as one of the greatest horror films ever made and after watching it, it's easy to see why. It is by far my favourite film in George A Romero's &#34;Dead&#34; movie series, a franchise of films that many horror fans call legendary. When writing this review, I have watched all the films in the series up until &#34;Land of the Dead&#34;, a film I didn't like which is why I had no desire to see &#34;Diary of the Dead.&#34;  The films plot is well-known by now, it's basically a zombie apocalypse and carries the story on from &#34;Night Of the Living Dead&#34; (released in 1968.) I love the setting in this film, the mall is a fantastic location for the main events to happen in the movie. The film is well-paced, has some enjoyable action scenes and well-written character moments. I like the cast best here (out of all the films I have seen in the series so far), the acting is strong  and Romero's directing is top-notch. There are many memorable moments, the movie has a very epic feel to it and the Zombies themselves are good here. You will not be disappointed with the ending either, the films climax is very well though out. &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; does has some comedy scenes, but these instances mix in well with the action and suspense. The tension is built up effectively and you always feel in the film that threat is never far away. Stephen King considers this one of his favorite horror films and that should give you an idea of how great it is.  The picture quality is good as well on this DVD. &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; is superior to &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; and &#34;Day of the Dead&#34; in my eyes, being much better than &#34;Land of the Dead.&#34; It's not my absolute favourite horror film ever, that would go to &#34;The Shining.&#34; But I can see why the movie is labelled as a classic zombie film. Romero was on top form here, it's my favorite movie of his to date.",1

"Watchable in an underwhelming way I had heard that this series was like the x-files, but not one episode of fringe really provoked much thought for me.  Walter Bishop was an extremely annoying character with a stupid accent.  Until I watched the special features I thought that maybe he was northern Irish or Scottish in real life, but no, he's American.  Very odd.  Also, is there anything he can't do?!  Heart surgery?  tick.  single handedly as well).  Autopsies?  Tick.  He can do those to.  Forensic analysis?  tick.  He's a one man band that guy.  Peter Bishop's character is just very sarcastic and bland.  He repeats back what his father's character has just told us, but saps any wonder out of it with his cynicial analysis.  Olivia Dunham never stops spinning.  From case to case to next case, she bounces, resting only briefly in a tank of water with wires attached to her brain, fuelled by coffee and sleeping the light on (once).  The special features say that the actress brought her vulnerability to the character of AGent Dunham.  I didn't really get that.  I thought she was like an invincible fearless cyborg.  But, good for her!  Astrid!  WEll what's her character for?  Just to ask Walter more questions for the viewer's benefit.",0
"Best. Game. Ever!!! This game is the best game I think I've ever played. It's for anyone, and has an enchanting story behind it. There are 10 chapters in which you need to guide princess Ida through impossible geometry, and while you work out a strategy, the game doesn't stress you! It's certainly worth the money. The only downside to this game is that saying &quot;only one more go,&quot; is something you can't be truthful about! But no, the downside is that it's pretty short, but still takes a few hours; plus you can play it again and again! You should definitely buy this game, it's the best ever!!! :-)",1

"SELF-APPRECIATIVE TRIPE I am aware that I am possibly the only person on the planet who will not be writing a glowing review of this 'film', and my lack of intellectual commendation and well timed media-luvvie styled praise (intermitently injected into barely comprehendable sentences celebrating 'enigmatic' & 'tormented' charactes - who don't get machettied for the sake of entertainment - in an 'abnormality of...  colour spectrum' through a film with 'buried symbology' and 'intricate soundscapes that blend dialogue', with 'profound transformation', ending with a product that 'time has only served to intensify [regarding] its transcendent force' and similar drivel) will likely not be well recieved. However, if you find the 'interseption of a ritualized slaughter' of a bull, pig, or any other living thing for that matter, an enjoyable inclusion for 'good measure' as another reviewer has put it, and that a man would include such grotesque and sickening action for the purpose of making his film feel more 'unusual' acceptable - then go ahead, watch this movie. Join the plethora of inhumane beings that don't appear to get the irony of their reviews. Celebrating the murder of a living thing for pure shock factor (oh sorry, I meant artistry) whilst droaning on about the 'intensity' and 'horror' of what are, lets face it - actors... and if you do 'enjoy' it... and agree with the rest of the 69 pages of praise, I'm sure there are some snuff movies you would also enjoy when you're done salavating over this tripe. I personally, would rather suck the snot out of my babies nose daily, than ever subject myself to the self-gratifying practices of a film-maker who values his 'art' so highly, that such horrifying suffering is seen as an acceptable means to an end.

"Struggled to get in to this book I started reading this with quite high hopes, but struggled to get in to it. The second half is so much better than the first, the characters are more developed by then. I found myself not really liking either of the two main characters, and subsequently not really caring much what happened to either of them, although it did become a bit obvious in the second half what was going on. I enjoyed it more towards the end, but did find it a bit unbelievable . Not sure I would be quick to recommend it, but probably is an ok holiday read.",0

"Beware of bogus imitations I had an afternoon off during the week when I saw that my local cinema was doing what appeared to be a retrospective screening of 'The Evil Dead'. I had never had the chance to see the film from the early 80's, so with great excitement I immediately purchased a ticket.....after all, what better way to first time view a classic? I had heard from several of my friends about the inventive, mad, grungy atmospheric feel to this film, so for me this presented a TRUE one off opportunity.<br /><br />What I got when the film started however, was a film that not only represented nothing of what I had hoped for, but also seemed to tie in with a lot of the themes for what I know as the current common denominator stock horror film. The key characteristics for this being perhaps an over reliance on noise for shock, paltry mundane gore effects, plot justification devices along with that typical polished colour scheme that is prevalent in nearly all current American horror. I did of course find out that this film was in fact entitled 'Evil Dead' and was not the '81 classic, but what a way to mislead, and leach off the success of a previous endeavour.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing a second hand DVD copy of the '81 version which was to my relief as good and as gritty as I had previously been told, however I cannot help feeling that my first viewing of this film has somewhat been robbed :(",0

"Raunchy moves, sexy music but not much else!!! Ever since 'Dirty Dancing' burst into our lives in the 1980's a string of dance movies have followed all striving to break into that special niche market that Dirty Dancing identified. We've since had 'Step Up', 'Save the Last Dance', 'Strictly Ballroom', 'Take the Lead' and 'Shall we Dance' to name but a few and they have all more or less had varying degrees of success. While the dancing in these movies is always excellent the storyline often leaves alot to be desired    Thankfully Dirty Dancing 2 at least makes an effort to avoid the over-worked storylines of its predessors. Yes it's still far from original being as usual the story of girl meets boy, girl discovers the passion of dance and surprise surprise falls in love with boy but what makes this movie different is the political background to it being set during the time of the Cuban Missiles Crisis, which adds a greater sense of depth to this movie as issues such a class, culture, race and politics come into play. Unfortunately despite the reasonably promising storyline the script is very weak so this movies never really manages to take flight and become the great movie that I'm sure it could have been under better guidance. The script writer seems to appear rather confused as to what he/she wanted to achieve from this movie. The political background is kept very much to the background, (understandably in a movie about dance) so unless you actually have an understanding of the situation in Cuba during the 1950's you really won't understand what's happening alot of the time regarding this issue. To call this a fault would be unfair but since the Revolution does have a major impact on the lives of the protagonists at the end it is strange that not more emphasis was placed on it. What is also surprising is that this movie lacks any humour, something strange in a movie that does appear to be light-hearted. But nevertheless this movie does survive these problems due to its brevity (standing at only 1hr18mins it's far from long) and rather original ending.    The acting throughout is fairly passable. However what really intrigued me was the fact that although the two leads had never had any dance experience they managed to pull off the dance moves with a grace and charm that would have easily fooled even the most expert of dance experts. This, in my opinion is this movie's saving grace: the catchy music and routines that will have you all enquiring about your local salsa classes. Ignore the fact that the leads don't really have much on-screen appeal. The chemistry between them is non-existent and Romola Garai is particularly wooden. While this performance works at the start as she plays the shy, newcomer trying to find her feet on foregin land it becomes progressively dull as the movie advances and she is supposed to be becoming more confident as her passion for dance takes flight. Alas this transformation never occurs leading me to wonder if Romola has the star quality to play a leading lady (she was little better in Atonement or I capture the Castle).     But on the whole this is a reasonably colourful movie. The costumes are cute and twirly (so much better than Dirty Dancing), the music raunchier and the dance moves sexier. I would have liked to have seen more shots on location as at times too many scenes are shot indoors but this is nothing serious.    To conclude Dirty Dancing 2 is alot better than Dirty Dancing, (though I must confess I never really liked Dirty Dancing. I found it to be one of the most over-rated movies of the 20th century) although calling it a sequel is a tad misleading since it's set in the 1950's and besides a cameo by Patrick Swayze there is little to remind us of the original. A good movie for a wet afternoon or a night in with the girls, just don't expect life altering material here.",0

And I did, I left it for about 3 weeks, then today I picked it up to get it over and done with. I would recommend it but for me it wasn't one of those books where I felt I had to read on.

"Lowering the tone Having encountered the peek of what could happen in the red room of pain Ana has decided to take a step back and move forward in publishing.<br />Having landed the job she innocently tells the control freak Christian of the position so is once again under the thumb which does work out beneficial for her in the long run in terms of her seedy boss.<br />Christian has a new proposal and attitude it seems which makes Ana's resolve waver.<br /><br />After the pathetic last \\""""villain\\"""" being a stalker this one is no better i'm afraid so i'm definitely switching off from the series.<br />The sex scene's are constant making me actually feel like I want a break from them. More story and less spanking please!<br />The fact that by this point they've only been dating mere weeks makes the whirl wind romance seem very far fetched. Christian is an abusive control freak who admitted he gets off on causing women pain, why would we fantasize to have a man like that in our lives? I'd rather a poor man to love me and treat me with respect any day.<br /><br />I was caught up in the initial story but as i've read on it makes me think it should have had more plot or been a stand alone novel.<br />It's been compared to the Twilight series but I personally can't see it as they were actually worth buying the last in the saga",0

"Spectacular soulful sounds! I first heard about John Newman when I saw him performing on Jools Holland's show. I was very impressed with his soulful voice and charisma. Some people compare him to Plan B, but I much prefer Newman. His voice, to me, seems to be a cut above the rest. This voice added to the beautiful cacophony of sound coming from the trumpets, violins, drums etc, as well as the great melody's, make this album one to buy immediately!",1

"No Masterpiece. Not that Funny Very like the book \\""""Water for Elephants\\"""" where a an old man reminices about his life and he too ran away from the old folks home he was in!!!! and in his youth he studied for a while as a vetinary student left to join a circus as a vet and him and his girlfriend takes the elephant with them as it is being cruelly treated and they find a home for it. Also echoes forest Gump as a half witted man and his half witted friend always seem to land on their feet.<br />This book I didn't find funny, he is no PG Wodehouse, but it is witty in parts. I don't see the point of the elephant in the story, it wasn't funny and didn't add anything to the story line. The book is 50% the past and 50% about the old mans' travels after he leaves the old folks home.<br /><br />It can be enjoyable in parts but definitely not worth 3-5 stars.<br /><br />I didn't buy from amazon got it from a friend very glad I did not waste my money on this. Not worth the time reading it nor the money to buy it.<br /><br />Very long. Switches from past to present.",0

My mother and I are convinced it was written by another and not khaled. Would not recommend.",0
"shining example of corporate greed Once upon a time there was an awesome instant messenger and chat client called Skype.

The new gems system is terrible too, it is basically impossible to get any of them and the gem guns just have good names. Speaking of the guns, they must have no knowledge of the economy as guns worth 90 coins are more powerful than ones that cost 400. Finally, Lethality ratings for weapons are just not specific enough.

"Action run through. I thought I liked this movie for the first half but began to get tired of the non-stop action. It starts quickly and doesn't stop for more than a few moments until the end. The plot is kind of thin on the ground and delivered in what feels like instalments in the bits where nobodies shooting. The original werewolf/vampire character; Michael? is noticeably 'removed' from this movie perhaps for the next instalment but I thought more likely he was just inconvenient to this movie which kind of demonstrates how this episode is just hammered on. All the more so because he could quite conceivably have been elsewhere considering developments in the world since the second movie which are very dramatic. The action though is much slicker than the others due I think to a bigger budget and I enjoyed it for what it was, but as relentless as the action is the movie ends all the more suddenly. I'm sure I could have thought of a better movie.",0
"Nothing special but an OK read. I found this book to be an easy read, but was one that I don't feel lives up to the hype of reviews. I found the characters difficult to relate too, found the 9/11 links made somewhat irrelevant, and the story did not evoke any form of emotions in me, and believe you me, I'm a sucker for that stuff! For me it lacked depth and believability, i think they only spend about 5 weeks together in their entire relationship, which spans a couple of years! The ending is a bit predictable, i saw it coming a mile off. As a quick, easy read, maybe as your holiday novel, its fine, but if you are looking for any kind of depth or substance, or the promised emotional rollarcoaster, you need to read his other books, message in a bottle or the notebook.",0

"Quality of book I wasn't overly impressed with my purchase, I thought that for a book in 'very good' condition was awful.

"Never Mind The Quality , Feel The Width. This review is in respect to the multi-disc 40th anniversary set . I think the performances , musically , are terrific . In my opinion Rory Gallagher was the best ever blues / rock artist .  The reason I have marked it down is the sound quality on the majority of the discs , and the packaging . At least four of the CD's are patently sub-standard sound quality wise .  Why they just didn't get the best two or three along with the DVD and package it differently , I have no idea .  The packaging also is flimsy , and should have been done like Bob Dylan Biograph's initial release in a sturdy box with proper CD cases .  Overall rather disappointing as a package . Surely it could have been done better than this ?",0

Ruined ending Before reading this be WARNED will include spoilers.<br />I seen the film advertised and decided to finally branch out from my twilight and black dagger brotherhood phase.<br />I thought to myself five books ? Its got to be good right ?<br />Wrong I spent five hours last night reading thiis book.<br />12pm to 5am becausr ill admit (this is the reason for the second star) I wanted Jace and C to have that moment im a sucker for romance and it was brewing. I was already to don a cheerleader outfit and cheer for the pair but midway through reading I realised.it was another cliche love triangle.<br />So I was already turning the page with my excitement diming.<br />Now I have two huge issues my main and reason for deleting the series.from my kindle will be last so firstly we have descriptions and use of words (im not the best writer etc and everyone to their own but this had my eyes re reading to see if I had it right)<br />First the blue haired dude wtf.was.that over ..<br />Secondly what was with isabella and the whip ....<br />Although I praise the author for Addressing Alec and.his.sexualty the.scene.with him and C was a little to cat fight screech for me.<br />Now the mentor becoming the bad guy .....that didnt make sense to me at all.<br />Now my main issue what the hell was the plot twist ending about SIBLINGS are you for real ......<br />With the disaapointment I decided to google.the ither four books and the whole plot with the two main characters.is pointless.<br />With a heavy heart I waved.a goodbye tho a story that could and should off been great. Whilst clicking deleting and dreaming of what better use I could of made with my time,0

"An uneven classic PET SOUNDS is a classic from the sixties. But not because of its catchy songs, but because of its innovative arrangements. This album opened the doors for better albums like REVOLVER and SGT PEPPER by the Beatles and BUTTERFLY by the Hollies.  Not bad at all, you sure have a few good songs here like \\""""Wouldn't it be nice\\"""" and \\""""God only knows\\"""". But if you want an album with only good songs, you might be disappointed. This is not even Beach Boys' best album, that would be \\""""Summer days\\"""".  Also notice that while Brian Wilson was playing around with an orchestra, Beatles had George Martin who actually knew what he was doing.",0
"Most awful and overrated album of all time.  Except for The Wall by Pink Floyd, perhaps. I am actually angry that I have spent money on this album that I won't ever get back.  I even expended some of my life listening to it.<br />It is one of the worst albums I have ever sat through, and certainly one of the most overrated.<br />Whatever he was trying to do, it didn't work - unless, that is, Trent Reznor aimed to write an hour of pointlessly pompous prose with vile lyrics that neither moved nor affected the listener.  It was just noise.  S***t noise.<br />And as for Hurt?  Well, it's always impressive when somebody covers a song that may be considered better than the original.  But on this occasion it was actually insulting how poor and unsatisfying the original was in comparison to the cover by a frail 70 year old man (Johnny Cash).<br />Do yourself a favour, whatever money you were going to spend on this album, don't put it into Mr Reznor's pocket.  Burn it.  That way, you're still £5 down but you've at least refused to financially support another album by this dire composer.  He shouldn't be allowed within 3 miles of an instrument.

Interesting read This was an interesting read as well as being an easy read. There were some irritating characters but then there are some irritating people in real life so it was believable. It was a pity that the main character was one of the irritating ones! Nonetheless I would recommend it.,0

"A good novel but not a 'psychological thriller' I wouldn't call this book a 'psychological thriller' but it has suspense and a very good story-line. The plot is a little dull, but it speeds up for the final few chapters. The violence is not at all graphic as some reviewers would have you believe, if anything it's tempered enough so as not to be completely realistic. I find real life abuse is much more graphic and often so unbelievable that when writing about it you have to dull it a little otherwise readers wouldn't find it authentic. I enjoyed the pace but found much too much explanatory details about OCD and telling instead of showing what had happened/was happening. A good book is one where you are shown things and have to work it out for yourself. For a debut novel this is a very good book, but I expect the author forgot that readers are intelligent enough to do the guesswork themselves and don't need to be told everything. I would recommend this book if you want a realistic portrayal of domestic abuse. I recommend 'Before I go to sleep' by S. J. Watson, if you want to read a psychological thriller.",1

could play it for hours This game is brilliant I love it it is funny and it gives you the sense of achievement when you unlock a new character or beat your high score it is a great game to pass the time it goes with the theme of blocks so its bound to be popular just like all the other blocky games. People go mad for things that are popular some people don't even care if it's any good it's just like omg that game is blocky I have to have it but with this I would highly recommend getting it and if you are one of those people sorry I meant no offense,1

"'MURDER IN THE 'BACKWATERS' 'Tommy Lee Jones' rarely makes a poor movie, he has a kind of screen presence which could be misinterpreted by some, he's  pretty laid back, and his portrayals often seem effortless.<br />In my opinion in this movie he's on form, and gives a performance that we've come to expect from him.<br />he plays a cop 'Dave Robicbeaux; who realizes when a body is found from 45 years ago, he actually witnessed the shooting.<br />Not only is he on the trail of the killer from way back, a series of present day killings are some how linked to the earlier crime.<br />with some gritty scenes,perhaps a little short of exciting,  i think it's worth a viewing.",0
great game Well done  great game,1
"Wasted potential for such a brilliant concept. Mark Millar and Superman, in my ears, should be the winning combination, both being my favourite comic and the most influential superhero respectively. Add that with the awesome concept and you've got a winner, right? Nah.<br /><br />An Elseworlds tale (Elseworlds refers to stories released by DC that do not exist in regular continuity, but in alternate realities), Superman Red Son takes place in a world where the all-American heroic boy scout we know and love as Superman did not land in Smallville USA, but in a collective farm in Stalinist Russia. The Superman stands as a symbol for dictator Josef Stalin's Soviet Russia and is regarded by the rest of the world as a threat in the height of the Cold War.<br /><br />One would imagine that this would be a story about an evil communist Superman who wants nothing more than to destroy America, but while this could have been a standard Marxism vs Capitalism political story, Mark Millar actually takes an objective, mature perspective on the concept and creates a rich alternate DC Universe that creates a sense of moral ambiguity on both sides. The Man of Steel himself is at his core, the exact same man Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster wrote 75 years ago. Just because he follows a different flag, he does not discriminate when it comes to protecting all mankind, regardless of political orientation. Other regulars include Lois Lane - or rather Lois Luthor! Yes, the Daily Planet journalist is wife of Lex Luthor, the same American scientist who wants nothing more than to destroy Superman. Wonder Woman appears as a friend of Superman's, while their two nations, Themyscera and Russia form a Pact against the Western World. Probably my favourite reiteration of a popular DC hero is that of Batman - anarchy in black! This version of the Dark Knight is a Russian freedom fighter devoted to bringing down the Soviet Union, although he is a far different man than we knew before. This Batman and no morals holding him back from killing. This Batman is far more like V, the main character of Alan Moore's V for Vendetta. Unfortunately, after Batman's page presence is made, things start to go downhill.<br /><br />The book begins with so much promise, with a world familiar yet different to comics fans that comments on social issues of the Cold War, and even extending to current events. But as the book goes on, things get extremely ridiculous. Far too much time is taken to say that they live in a wonderful society where nothing goes wrong and all the happy people are holding hands and smiling, without telling us how and why this makes sense. Awful deus-ex machinas are pulled out of nowhere with the only explanations being &#34;Lex Luthor is impossibly smart&#34; and &#34;Superman is impossibly fast&#34;. And, as with much of Millar's older works, way too much focus us put on plot exposition, explaining the unwanted science behind a character's actions, and filling in the gaps (because apparently you can't tell one simple narrative story without some more filler), but no reason as to why we should give a damn. When the story is done, these are but hollow shells of the characters we know. And I won't even spoilt the dreadful ending. If less time had been spent on flashy art and dull, predictable plot, and more on the characters, then we would have had a masterpiece. Instead, we have a book that would only have been great in the 90's. Oh yeah, I said it.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I would not go out of my way to buy this disappointment. The merits are overshadowed by the flaws which is a true shame.",0

"No more overworked fantasy novels Like all the Rothfuss fans out there, I was exceptionally excited to get this book, and purposefully reread the NOTW to refresh my memory. I still rate NOTW as one of the best Fantasy novels I've ever read, and much of this was due to Patrick Rothfuss's phenomenal imagination and innocent writing style.<br />By the end of WMF, I was cursing this same author for transforming my love of Kwothe to absolute annoyance and irritation, and had to force myself to read the last 100 pages. This book felt so overworked that it lost much of the innocence of the NOTW, and the infantile projections of hero worship onto the main character became more annoying as the book progressed. What started out as brilliant adult fantasy has now progressed to juvenile projections of an alter ego, and has left me feeling thoroughly disappointed.<br />Will lastly mention the I desperately wanted to love this book, but if you want intelligent adult fantasy then rather move on to Steven Erikson",0
"Not as good as the adverts made out Weird soundtrack for something set in what 20's china? Did not mix well with the settings or fight scenes which were choreographed well. Quite a shame really it could have been great, sadly the rap spoilt the whole feel for me, it was just so out of place. Just because your hero is black doesn't mean the music has to be urban especially in a fantasy/ adventure.",0

"The Hopkins Album It is traditional to laud the first two Quicksilver albums - especially Happy Trails - and to decry the later Dino Valenti dominated works. In hindsight both eras had both strengths and weaknesses, but this all overlooks the album that linked the two eras - Shady Grove. This was actually the first Quicksilver album I heard/bought and is a thing of itself. At this point Gary Duncan had gone off with Dino Valenti to form another band, and in his place was recruited not another guitarist but the piano maestro, Nicky Hopkins, familiar from session work with the Rolling Stones, Who, and lots of other bands. This is one of the best places to hear Hopkins, accompanied by the searing guitar of John Cippolina, and features his standout extravaganza, Edward, the Mad Shirt Grinder, which many would argue is worth the price of the album on its own.<br />Other great tracks are Shady Grove and Joseph's Coat which are both epic in scope. However, the rest of the album is not so strong with a lively workout in Holy Moly, still reflection on Flute Song, but other weaker numbers too.<br />Adding to the unique sound on this album are the vocals and violin of David Freiberg.<br />The remastering has done something to lift the 'fug' which seemed to befuddle the original releases, but it is worth being aware that 4 of the best tracks appear on the Sons of Mercury compilation (on Rhino), again with excellent sound.<br />Maybe 3 1/2 would be fairer.",0
"so boring!! not even finished watching series 1, so boring!!!",0
"Cool, but not catchy. I got this after loving Kimbra on the Gotye collaboration &#34;Someone that I used to know&#34; (which is not on this album) and also after hearing &#34;Settle Down&#34; during an interview with Kylie Minogue who was raving about her.  I still love &#34;Settle Down&#34; which is the first song on the album, but the rest of the album is not for me I'm afraid.  After listening to it twice all the way through and not getting into it, I was left thinking that none of the other songs are memorable enough for me to want to play the album for a third time.  I might try the Gotye album instead.",0

"final fantasy vii update - I guess no-one took the dvd from my bin - even the binman threw it back into the recycle box ... so for the sake of trying to be objective I actually continued to watch ... but I only managed to get to the 80% mark this time before my hair fell out and I pulled my own fingernails off - I can confirm that the story is just dire and STILL I cannot finish this film ... even the transformers story line is positively realistic compared to this absurdity ... not even watchable after a saturday beer - or 8 ... I stand accused of having had nothing better to do and confess to having had wasted 80 mins of my life<br /><br />this has to be one of the most dire pieces of guff that I've ever watched - having had 100's of products from Amazon I have never yet had the urge to write a review as almost all products do what they say but this dvd has rattled me ... I was looking for the production date on this dvd and expected to see 1975 or thereabouts, ie a time when graphics could sell on the basis that there was movement, but no .... I couldn't get beyond 50% through it as the story is just so childish ... if anyone wants my copy please come and collect it from my bin - is there a 0/5 score anywhere please?",0

"Uneventful Yet Undemanding It is evidence enough that there are a variety of interesting qualities and overbearing faults within the book, but overall Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is at best an average read that just prolongs a series that apparently becomes more evolved and 'dark'. The lack of detail used to create events and keep readers attention isn't used to great effect at times and the silly description though engulfs the Hogwarts world at times into a place of fun, to me just turns it into a place of mockery. Themes are used well to teach us more about social acceptance in our own culture but the lack of atmosphere fails to turn the book into something more thought provoking.",0

"4-Stars For the Film, 1-Star For The New UK Blu-Ray Release You don't need to know anything about this film, as you'll either love it or hate it! (There's no inbetweening, when it comes to NATURAL BORN KILLERS!) However, my reason for this post, is to warn others about this new UK release!<br /><br />Once again, we UK Blu-Ray fans get royally screwed-over! Despite being advertised as the 20th Anniversary Edition, this is NOT in fact the case!<br /><br />What you get, is:<br />- The Uncut Director's Cut (122 minutes)<br />- NBK Evolution: How Would It All Go Down Now? (documentary)<br />- Commentary and Introduction by Oliver Stone<br />- Chaos Rising: The Storm Around Natural Born Killers (documentary)<br />- Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Oliver Stone (about 20 minutes worth)<br />- Charlie Rose Interview of Oliver Stone (featurette)<br />- Alternate Ending with Introduction by Oliver Stone, and the<br />- US Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />. However, in the USA, Warners are releasing the proper 20th Anniversary Edition, which includes:<br />- The Original Theatrical Cut (119 minutes), PLUS<br />- The Uncut Director's Cut (122 minutes)<br />- Housed in a new DIAMOND LUXE, Steelbook-style case<br />- Natural Born Killers: Method In The Madness (All-new feature-length documentary, featuring director Oliver Stone, editor Hank Corwin and technical advisor Dale Dye, who unleash the cinematic tools of controlled chaos they used to make the film<br />- PLUS ALL of the other stuff listed above, on the new UK Blu-Ray!<br /><br />This item can be Pre-Ordered from Amazon.com at...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L9057FS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />... and costs less than £18, including Standard Shipping to the United Kingdom! It's released on 9th December 2014. Thus, making it better, (but as-pricey), as this lame-assed release, that has been fobbed-off onto us UK-based NBK fans! On top of this, the US release is REGION FREE, so will already work in all UK Blu-Ray players!<br /><br />The US 20th Anniversary Edition is what we should be getting, but it isn't! When companies treat UK film fans with this amount of utter contempt, is it any wonder that the UK fans then go and buy foreign releases?! As such, Warners UK deserves to be shot for this joke of a release! Shame on them!<br /><br />I'm returning my UK version straight back to Amazon for a full refund, and am plumping for the new US set instead! Do NOT purchase the UK version, but go and pre-order the superior US release instead!

"In a nutshell: insightful but rambling There are many reviews here already, so I'll keep this short:     - Content: makes insightful points on limitations of our knowledge, human temptation to identify false trends and narratives, follow herd mentality, blindly follow 'experts', and so forth. He calls this 'skeptical empiricism'.    - Style: long-winded and rambling, skipping from personal stories from Lebanon, to parables intended to represent the author, to dull discussions on history of mathematics. I didn't mind it, but some readers hate it.    - Author: massively arrogant and up himself. Thinks he's had the best idea since sliced bread. He's got a good idea, but he's not the first or the only one, just the one with the biggest mouth.    - Other reads: there are better books out there on similar subjects. John Kay (of the FT) writes essays from a similar position, much more concisely and more to the point.    Hope that helps!",0

"176 pages of script. 64 pages of art [[VIDEOID:5707584]]I've rated this book 2 stars for that represents directly the amount of art in this book. The 64 pages of art are of top notch quality featuring extremely high resolution concept art and great storyboards. If not for that, I have no doubt I would have given this book 1 star.<br /><br />Where the script starts is where the book begins its downward descent. If the publisher was to sell the art pages separately as a separate book, I would gladly pay half the price for it. The shooting script is not helpful unless you're planning to remake the movie yourself, and if you think you can shoot it better than C. Nolan.<br /><br />This is a movie made from a comic book series. I'm frankly amazed that there is so little art.<br /><br />At the time I bought the book, there weren't any consumer reviews out yet. Now, these reviews are available to help you make the correct decision.<br /><br />I've never bought a book after flipping a few pages, immediately feel like returning it straight away.<br /><br />There are more pictures on my blog.

"watch this as our world collapses I first saw Koyaanisqatsi over twenty years ago and I found it quite dramatic and engaging. Life out of balance, a way of life that calls for change... But of course nothing has changed since the film came out in 1983. Things have just got worse. There has been no green revolution. Civilization, business, industry has continued to bulldoze a brutal path through Nature, with no regard for the environment, for wildlife or for indigenous peoples. The world is so out of balance now that it's hard to imagine any balance being restored. The scales tip ever more towards a state of total collapse. The Philip Glass soundtrack is the soundtrack to the end of the world as we know it. Watching this film in 2015 is just depressing!<br />As for Powaqqatsi... I didn't make it all the way through. Some interesting and arresting images, for sure, but it lacked the sense of drive behind Koyaanisqqatsi and so seemed pointless.",0

"A Great Story Badly Told. I picked up this book several times in the bookstore and almost bought it on the strength of its cover reviews. When eventually I did succumb to the temptation and took it home I did genuinely find it difficult to put it down. Having said that, there were times when it was equally difficult not to throw it out of the window. This is a wonderful adventure story but it's way, way too long. Although the ludicrously overblown prose and relentless naval gazing really did grate at times the story itself kept me engaged right to the end.",0

"very good best of, but...why  two bluray? honestly, I don't understand why  two blurays for just 25 videoclips and making of,otherwise PICTURE 8/10 SOUND 4/10 because just stereo, no remix in 5.1 it's not a good job.",0
"Ok - but average I first tracked down the arctic monkeys after reading an NME review saying they were going to be the next big thing. Having heard them I think that the NME was probably right. This is the kind of music that can make a band in the UK, unfortunately that means it is pop laced rock, with the emphasis on catchy riffs as the above reviews read. I dont have anything against this band, some of the songs are genuinely catchy and will get you tapping toes,desks etc. However it is middle of the road music aimed at a younger scene and basically not that interesting in the long term/multiple play pile. Some good ideas from some young guys with a promising future, still well worth a listen but with a shelf life.",0
"Not as good as her other books..... I love Sophie Kinsella's books and I have to say that she's my favourite author, this book however is a real disapointment.    My main problem with it is the mother/daughter relationship and the mother bringing up a child in such a strange horrible way and being completely oblivious to how spoilt and brattish the child's behaviour is. It completely spoilt it for me as I didn't feel my usual warmth to the main characters. I found the child's behaviour awful and although I finished the book I wont be picking it up again which is unusual for me as I normally like to re-read most of Sophie's books because they are normally so good.    I think the main problem was reading about the way the child was being bought up and her behaviour was just awful, I was frustrated as I was reading it, thinking sort your child out!  Hopefully this is just a blip and I'll certainly still be buying her next book.",0

"True Rock Classics ,From The Legendary British Band UFO. UFO are without a doubt one of the greatest rock bands to come out of the 70's. And if you've ever heard them you know why I say this.  These are the first five studio albums to feature Michael Schenker, and in my opinion are the bands greatest works, not including their live masterpiece Strangers In The Night. While this is a bare bones collection, no extras here, it is well worth having to keep in your auto, or just for backups, and at the price you can't go wrong.  The only thing missing is an original running order Strangers In The Night .",1

"Helloween Meets The Spinners - Absolute Garbage This is without question the worst album Helloween have ever released. To turn such a great set of tracks into a parody of themselves is truly inexcusable.<br /><br />If you like Helloween's original sound and cuts of these tracks then you'll be nothing short of insulted by what they have done here.<br /><br />If however you like the sound of a soft rock Helloween turned into a mad mix of the Spinners and the Wurzels, with a bit of weird jazz & children thrown in then go for it.<br /><br />I truly don't understand what they were thinking. Please do not buy this rubbish it will only encourage more of it!<br /><br />If it was possible to give less than 1 star, this would be rated as -5.",0

Four Stars Not a bad film. 3d was good . If you like Tom cruise your like this film.,1
"Its alright... Its okay. The book size is a bit on the small side (especially if you are as creative as me) and the pages are a bit thin so if you wanted to use felt-tip pens they do show through to the next page. I wanted to create a memory book but its more of an activity book. For example, you have to lose the book, give away a page etc. Because of this, i never actually completed it as it wasn't really my cup of tea. It is a very interactive book if you like that sort of thing. I prefer the Smash Books as you can make them look really nice and the pages are of high quality, however, i have seen some examples of this book looking really amazing so it really depends on how you make it!",0

Five Stars Great series,1
"One of the most realistic books ever written. It is a weird, wonderful, horrifying, amazing, terrifying and brilliant book. It is perhaps the best thing I have ever read.<br /><br />The first chapter, told from the writer's perspective, explains how he has tried for ages to write about his experiences in the fire-bombing of the German city of Dresden, during the closing months of the Second World War. He has explained how he has failed to do this, and promises that his next book will be better; more fun.<br /><br /> He then proceeds to tell the story of a man called Billy Pilgrim, who came unstuck in time. Billy Pilgrim, an American soldier, becomes a German prisoner-of-war and is sent to Dresden. All the while through the narrative he keeps finding himself at different times in his life, experiencing events both before and after the war. He sees his childhood, his later life as an optician/optometrist, his marriage and family, his abduction by aliens called Tralfamadorians, his injury in a plane crash, his infatuation with the books of a science-fiction writer named Kilgore Trout, and his eventual attempts to tell the world about his abduction by the alien Tralfamadorians.<br /><br />Vonnegut's writing style is completely accessible - broad, clear sentences, simple enough for anyone to understand, possibly even children. He tells you what happens; no deception, no complex words, no nuanced sentences. He tells you how the characters feel, and why they feel that way, and he does this in as few words as possible - and whereas normally this would not work in a piece of fiction, somehow his broadness, his honesty, or something else, makes it work perfectly. It is therefore a nice short book, and you can read it very quickly. It took me under forty-eight hours to finish it; very few books can keep me riveted for so much of my time. In total I put it down three times since I first opened it.<br /><br />The subject-matter of course is dark. In fact, it's one of the darkest books I have ever read, dealing not just withthe actual horrors of total war, but with varying attitudes to said war when it's finally over, and when decades have passed. Vonnegut likens it to the Children's Crusade, which he outlines in chapter one. But there is a definite sense of humour in the telling, as though in the narrative he has an occasional grim, almost ironic chuckle every now and then. There are moments when I wasn't sure whether I should laugh or cry, or maybe both, and this weird juxtaposition kept me a little off-balance as the bite-sized prose drew me ever onwards. The only other of Vonnegut's works that I have read, Breakfast of Champions, which deals with consumerism and American society, also used this method; but more often than not with Breakfast of Champions I felt happier about laughing - I felt terrible about it, but it was still kind of funny. It was horribly funny, whereas Slaughterhouse 5 is funnily horrible. Maybe it's just that the topics in modern American society are inherently less dark than large-scale massacres and war, and so the same methods have yielded very different results.<br />One of the main comedic elements is the insertion of the sci-fi pulp-fiction elements, with the abduction by the Tralfamadorians and brief plot-synopsise of Kilgore Trout's books, and the reader's constant jerking-around through time. Vonnegut mentioned at the beginning how hard it was for him to write about his experiences in Dresden, and this must be the weird method he used to get around that.<br /><br />So this is it, then. Read this book. Get your hands on a copy of it somewhere. There is no excuse; I'm recommending it, you can read it in a day; it's easy to read and understand. Read it. Just get those words and read them. I can also recommend Breakfast of Champions, if you want a follow-up or something that isn't quite as bleak as hell. If it sounds like something you don't think you'd like, then read it anyway. You might be surprised. People have tried to ban it, which is the mark of any good book. Just read it, from start to finish, and I can guarantee that you will be a better person for it.",1

"OK I watched this film with great expectations but was a little disappointed the end of the film was a bit flimsy, I do like Nicolas Cage and he played a good part also Meg Ryan. Story at end weak.",0
"Do not be put off! Do not be put off by my scoring! This is a fantastic read, however I found that the ending let me down alongside the fact that I do not believe this book is anywhere near as effective as TFIOS or LFA.<br /><br />I loved the character of Q and found his quirky, lovable character to be my second favourite feature of this book, falling just behind the mystery they must unravel.<br /><br />Although slightly confusing at first, the mystery and sacrifices they go through are geniusly thought out and I commend John Green for these.<br /><br />Overall, a decent read.",0

"First 2/3 are really cool, last 1/3 suck bigtime. I had been looking SO much forward to this book, couldn't wait to read it. The premise of the story is awesome and there are some nice twists and things that surprise you about the plot. However, the last ca 1/3 of the book degenerates into such an uninspired and generic story that I couldn't wait for it to end. I was really disappointed.",0
Time Consuming The game is good apart from the fact that some items take far to long to grow so to speak. But other use it is a good game. It would have gotten a few more stars bit for the fact that the buildings need a lots of materials but you never seem to be able to get them and then have a lot of building halfway through construction.,0
"Extremely scary with lots of suspense. This movie is terrifying! Although, it does use the first person video camera effect which I feel is now often overused with modern movies. This movie seems to pull it off though while being original.<br /><br />I love horror movies and this is one of the scariest I've seen. Everything is brilliantly timed and executed flawlessly.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I wasn't too much of a fan of the little girl being a zombie, I find that idea a bit too cliche, also I thought she was a little unconvincing in parts, but that was really after my second or third viewing of the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching REC 2 if you enjoyed this movie. It doesn't fail to disappoint. It's one of the best sequels I've seen. Although, stay away from the third one, REC: Genesis, I've heard nothing but bad reviews about it.<br /><br />This movie is stunning on Blu-ray.",1

"Maybe you had to be there. Paice, Lord and Glover have their usual top-notch outings, their performances give the music on this CD all it's structure and make the songs recognisable.<br /><br />Blackmore and Gillan.... Not good.<br /><br />I'm obviously not hearing what the other reviewers are hearing. They're bladdy awful on this.<br /><br />It's a curiosity, nothing more. I had to buy it because I'm a completist, but I would never play it to demonstrate the titanic power of Deep Purple. That's coming from a nutty fan of Richie Blackmore (The Man, End Of).<br /><br />Gillan sounds ill, Blackmore plays like he's plastered... Or, he is just exploring the very outer reaches of expression, interpretation and improvisation... And I'm not getting it.<br /><br />Not even remotely comparable to Made In Japan. Not a patch on the Stuttgart and NEC '93 recordings.<br />In The Absence Of Pink is better (to my ears).<br /><br />In short; if you're a hardcore Purple fan, you have to buy it. If you're looking to buy your first Purple reccud... This would just baffle you.",0

"back to kill 'em all Metallica has gone back to their beginnings. It is certainly not, in my opinion, their best album and I've heard them all. After the plunge they took with St. Anger it seems they are trying to find their magic back again.   In similarity Death Magnetic sounds most like Kill 'Em All. It has got lots of that heavy metal distortion on both James' and Kirk's guitars but much more raw than any of their albums up to S&M. They have reversed the mistake they did in St. Anger by making Lars' drums sound like tin cans, so now they sound like they used to.   Lyrically there isn't much new but in the sense that it does almost feel like deja vu.    Overall I would rate Death Magnetic as better than St. Anger but not as good as their Load, ReLoad, Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, ...And Justice For All or any of the rest.  They have deffinitely come out of the pit where they found their muse or inspiration for St. Anger but still got lots of work to do to fill in the shoes of their \\""""one of the best metal bands ever\\"""" title.",0
"A chore to read and *not* pratchett - did he write this or just put his name to it? The only discworld novel i've really had to slog through.<br /><br />Years ago while working for a sci fi and fantasy published I was told that \\""""Pratchett doesnt write his own books anymore, he just oversees somebody else writing to a 'franchise'\\""""<br /><br />I didn't want to believe it at the time but it's the only real explanation.  I found that while the books have always been a tad formulaic (especially the early 'discworld discovers films/music etc etc but it's really evil and the day is saved by unlikely hero) that the entire tone and style changed with 'Night Watch' which was darker, more brooding and full or pathos but clearly not the same author who had written 'guards guards'.  Every book since then has further convinced me that TPs role in the later novels is that of an 'authenticator' or 'advising editor'.<br /><br />It's a terrible shame that such a fantastic author has become so ill but I'd rather remember him for writing great books than for putting his stamp on poor ones.",0

"A minority opinion I was very disappointed in this book. I sent for it on the recommendation of my son, and had high expectations. However, the layout is difficult (although this alone would not necessarily be an obstacle)and there are far too many photographs, mainly of Jamie. I have great admiration for him, not least for his energy and enthusiasm,  but I don't want his photograph album. As for the recipes, I was immediately put off by the number of ingredients, many of them certainly not standard in my kitchen. For example, opening the book at random, one part of one dish requires the following: fennel seeds, a small red onion, fresh red chilli, mixed jarred olives (stoned), tomatoes, ras el hamout (??), saffron and fresh coriander. That's a lot of ingredients, and by no means all of those required for that particular recipe.<br /><br />I have given this book two stars, but have to say that I didn't try the recipes, so my opinon may not be entirely fair. However,  for me, a cookery book has to attract before I want to try its recipes, and this one did not, so I have sent it back.<br /><br />I'm happy to accept that Jamie's book is great for some (the sales figures speak for themselves), and maybe I'm too plain a cook. But for me, nothing beats Katie Stewart's Times Cookery Book, sadly long out of print (although I recently bought a replacement second-hand, as mine had worn out).",0

"Moving, Suspenseful, Powerful & Beautiful The Lovely Bones is one of the most moving and powerful books I have ever read. It is strongly suspenseful, yet beautifully deacriptive: Alice Sebold describes her own beautiful perception of the after live, which proves to be a lovely fantasy land. Got me thinking shortly after I finished reading it for the fourth time about my own private perception of death. However, the main 14-year-old character that is murdered in this book is deeply disturbed & fustrated watching over her family from heaven, knowing that her murderer is still on the loose and is capable of anything. Brilliant, moving, suspenseful & beautiful, I fully recommend The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold to everyone.<br />May I also recommend the 2009 film adaptation. Amazing film, however you will be slightly disappointed, but almost fully satisfied with the film! 99% recommend the film to.",1

Disappointing This isn't the film I saw in 1970; this isn't the Elvis I saw in 1970. Careful interpretation of the sleeve notes shows this film to be compiled from the bits from the cutting-room floor.

"Oh Please..........shut up!! Ok so after all the hype I thought I should check out this fifty shades saga, I then felt the need to read all 3 books so that I could fairly write a review. I am so glad that the books are over. What an absolute pile of crap. For starter, I would love to know exactly how many times the most irritating words \\""""oh my\\"""" \\""""oh please\\"""" and \\""""baby you are so ready\\"""" are actually written down throughout the whole series, If I ever hear anyone say those words again, I cannot be held accountable for my actions. The fact that this virgin manages to accomplish and orgasm every single time Mr Grey touches her, even just nipple tweaking, yes my backside she does, it takes years to manage that, or possibly even never. In a few weeks, engaged, a few months married and then falls pregnant immediately....whatever?!!??!! As for the far fetched story line, yes the book is aimed at women who are attention seekers and like unrealistic drama in their lives, such as kidnapping, stalkers etc all attention seeking stuff really. In the end I would skip the never ending sex scenes, as I think maybe the author copied and pasted the first sex scene and repeated about 300 times throughout! Absolutely the biggest let down of a book I have ever read after so much hype. I think if this book has become so famous for the sex storylines, I should get a career in writing and tell it how it really is................all in all, what a ridiculously crap series, and irritating as hell, any normal woman would have given the moody sulky control freak that is Mr Grey the big heave ho after maybe chapter 7 of the first book.

"I picked up this book because I'd heard about the hype and was curious to see whether it deserved it. The short answer is no, it doesn't. There are any number of books that are better written, better plotted, more evocative, more gripping etc. The characters are stereotypes, and one dimensional stereotypes at that, mainly lifted wholesale from Upstairs Downstairs: the loyal, dedicated butler, the flustered yet motherly cook, the inept and possibly simple scullery maid. Not that I'd mind that as such, so long as the whole was done with some style, wit or flair, all of which are sadly lacking. Mostly it's pretty dull and long winded. The much heralded plot twists were easy to spot - I mean, who doesn't guess the 'secret' of Grace's parentage a good couple of hundred pages before an inkling dawns in the dim recesses of Grace's mind (how does she manage to get a doctorate - now, there's the real mystery). As to being literary...well, it's competently written, but nothing compared to what is generally considered to be literary writing.",0

"As a fan, I wasn't completely satisfied The Mortal Instruments is a very good, well written series and this installment is no exception. Parts of it are very funny, parts of it are very poignant and it does a good job of bringing in characters from the Infernal Devices series and leaves enough questions open for the dark artifices. However, as a huge fan of the series I didn't find this to be a completely satisfying ending (although of course there is still a sequel trilogy to go) and *SLIGHT SPOILER* there was one &#34;twist&#34; in the story that seemed to be put in there purely for shock value, only to be very quickly resolved.",0

"I Just Expected A Bit More I purchased this film because I made the mistake that is probably made by many people.  Well,I thought,there are so many well established actors in this film,it can't be all that bad.  And it wasen't bad,basically it was ok.  But,I wanted more from it.    Now,I don't know an awful lot about how this 'frase' came about,it started with a book in America or  something?.And I think it was mentioned in Sex And The City.  It was a good starting point for the film,having this shrine type bundle of words for women to  live their dating lifes by.  But enough about the title.    First of all,Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck's character's.......Unbelievably dull and predictable.  I knew what was going to 'develop' between these two just from watching the trailer.  Scarlett Johansson's 'Anna' came across as an aloof,inconsiderate tart.Same goes for Bradley Cooper's  Character 'Ben'.  Both of these were nowhere near developed,or likeable enough to maybe route for one of them a little bit.  At least I would have liked to have seen some genuine love between them,or maybe a clever twist involving  their affair.    Now I have to admit,the only other film I've seen Jennifer Connelly in,is The Labrinth.  In which I think she was awesome.  But in this,she comes across odd,out of place and as if she is on some sort  of medication.  She dosen't sit right in the film,to me anyway.    And in last place Drew Barrymore's charcter 'Mary'.  She dosen't conribute anything and is thrown together with Kevin Connelly's 'Cooper',  at the end.Very weak.    The only saving grace in the film,especially in regards to character development,  likeability,and engaging the audience,is Justin Long and Ginnifer Goodwin's Character's and  storyline.  In my oppinion,the two of them could have held the entire film,all on their own,without  the other fill in's.    If I had hated 'He's Just Not That Into You',it would be on it's way to some lucky  person through the wonderful world of the internet auction by now.But as with other past and future hyped up flicks..........it was just a little bit  of a let down.",0

"Good read -maybe 3 and half stars - but not 4 I have read 5 of Jojo Moyes's novels with Ship of Brides being my favourite - I would have given that 5 stars and the others at least 4.  I do not think this one is as good as the ones I have read and maybe 3 and a half stars would be nearer the mark.<br /><br />This novel covers a very thought provoking topic - Suicide & the right to die.<br /><br />It is the story of Will -  a young, mid 30s, successful, active man who after a traffic that was not his fault, is left paralysed and wanting to die  - and Louisa - a young woman in her mid 20s who after losing her job in a teashop becomes his companion on a 6 month temporary contract.  The novel is mostly written from Louisa's point of view but the family & friends of both of them also feature in the novel and some chapters are from their points of view.<br /><br />The story although sad does have many comic parts which help to lighten a difficult subject.<br /><br />The plot was quite predictable but that did not spoil the reading.  Would in reality the ending have been different? I do not know. The book does make you think about the quality of life and relationships.  This book is a romance and is much, much better than some \\""""chick lit\\"""" that I have tried to read without success.<br /><br />I did shed a few tears and the book is a good read and worth the time it takes to read it.",0

It's good to ask yourself questions about your faith and look at things you've sometimes taken for granted. I've heard Richard Dawkins on the radio so I looked forward to the book...I couldn't believe what I was reading!  It was a rant from start to finish. But not only was it childish it then lurched into malice towards believers. He pushed all the anti-christian cliches and prejudices - sometimes subtly, others crass. For anyone who is looking for a rational discussion of whether God exists or not, then stay clear of this book. My copy went straight into the recycle rubbish bag -it would have been better for the writer to have done likewise at the Proof Reading stage!",0

"Shame I can say I thought the First Instalment of Iron man was a classic superb film,With probobly one of the best orgin stories second only to cap's in my opinion I would give that film 4 Star's out of 5,The second Instalment was Good enjoyed it but lacked Somthing from the first I'd Give that 3 star's out of five a good film but not quite on the same level as the first.Iron mans Outing in avengers I would say was his best Yet he stole the show for me 5 out of 5 stars.So with iron man 3 I was full of antisipation as I thought this was gonna be the best film of the bunch And would Finish the triology in style.How wrong i was,Like all the previous Ironman film's this one did not dissapoint visualy and u could tell theyd spent a lot on the affects and looks of the film.I would say this film started of ok a little slow but ok,I liked how the once cocky self obsessedd,Tony Stark had a more human and humble deminar in this film after the event's which took place in the avenger's which in this film made him question everything from his self belif and so on,Like i said i felt the film started a bit slow until they introduced the mandarin then i was hooked I couldn't belive What i was seeing I thought Ironman had gone Dark knight on us with this evil dictator style charecter who seemed would stop at nothing to control the world and destroy anyone who got in his way including Ironman.You felt the mandarian was ironman's equal and would test Tony stark(Ironman) to the limit,Then came the Mandarin Twist and for me if i hadn't Just spent 30 quid treating the family and it was me who was driving I'd of quite honestly walked out the cinema in disgust,What could of been an epic film and a classic was ruined with one of the worst plot twists I've ever seen in a film the only good and ingenious thing about it is you would never of seen it coming in a million years.Some people would say that was what was so good about it thats' fine and i toataly respect ur opinion but for me it killed thefilm of straight away,It was like marvel were going one direction with the film then bottled it,Like so many film's know creators are scarred of offending people so they lower age ratings of films to get bum's on seats and to stay Pc.This film slightly redemmed it self at the end with the battle seens with all ironman's collection of suit's But for me it was to little to late.Like the title of the review say's I'ts a shame what they did with this film as if theyd' not done what they did with the mandarin and left it as it was this film could of been a classic and possibly the best Insalment of the Avenger's Franchise so far Shame.",0

"Songs in Search of a Melody As a longstanding Rush fan: I am sorry to put the cat amongst the pigeons of the previous glowing reviews; yes, I am reviewing this after one listen only; yes I know that Rush albums are \\""""growers\\""""...but... this album suffers in the same way that Vapor Trails did in that it has few, if any, melodies of substance pinned onto the instrumentation. <br /> <br />Adding extra syllables to the last word of a line of lyric and oscillating between two notes does not a melody make. Too frequently this is the pattern here and, in the words of \\""""We Hold On\\"""" - \\""""How many times/Do we chafe against the repetition.\\"""" Too often the melody line seems to sound like one you would make up on first run through but jettison on the grounds of lack of inspiration. <br /> <br />Lyricist Peart must shoulder some of the blame here: whilst the lyrics are as intelligent and thought provoking as ever they do not make for easy singing. Tricks such as rhyming the last line of each verse, rather than successive or alternating lines, demand a melody equal to the task and this is missing here on too many occasions. <br /> <br />Where Peart is writing to a regular verse form - as on The Larger Bowl (a pantoum)- the melody is strongest and adds rather than detracts from the whole. <br /> <br />As a live act Rush remain compelling and I will be amongst the faithful in attendance at the upcoming tour. On record, they are sadly, starting to test that loyalty. Either they are losing the muse or need a producer strong enough to say when the song lacks a tune.  <br /> <br />My appreciation of Rush is longstanding enough to ensure this album will receive plenty of plays in the coming weeks and it may be another \\""""grower\\"""" - if so I'll post to say I was over hasty and harsh. However, my fear is that, just like Vapor Trails before it, future listening will be narrowed to a select few tracks rather than the whole as was the case even on such relatively recent works as T4E and Counterparts. <br /> <br />Andrew, Stourbridge.UK",0

"Buy the Record The five leading roles in this production are very well cast. Ildebrando d'Arcangelo and Anna Netrebko are in perfect voice as Figaro and Susanna. I am used to seeing Anna Netrebko in bel canto and I was impressed with her range, both in acting and singing in this, more demanding role. Bo Skovhus was a convincingly slimy Almaviva and Dorothea Röschmann a sympathetic Countess, although her Dove Sono was a little understated. Christine Schäfer, in short trousers was a charming Cherubino. The lesser roles were not so well served. I liked Maria McLaughlin's twinkling Marcellina and Eva Liebau's naughty schoolgirl Barbarina but the male character roles were disappointing.<br /><br />Director Claus Guth seems to have visualised this comedy as a Strindbergian drama, or, to put it another way, he has removed all the comedy.  Da Ponte's libretto is plot driven so Guth simply ignores the plot. There are just two sets, a row of fitted wardrobes and a huge staircase. Opera directors love staircases. Whenever they cannot think of something for their characters to do they can have them go up and down the stairs. There is no Act IV garden scene, it takes place on the stairs. Over and over again, the characters are singing one thing while doing something different. Susanna has to sing \\""""If your ladyship will allow me, I'll stay among these trees\\"""", when she is actually standing on the staircase of Almaviva's house.<br /><br />Guth even adds a new character, Cherubim, an overgrown cherub who irritatingly hangs around throughout the action. Visually and dramatically, this is by far the worst of the ten versions of this opera that I have seen. It is very well sung so my advice would be to buy the CD. Citizens of Salzburg pay E350 a head to see this rubbish. There is a brief shot of the audience at the end. Most of the women are clapping politely while their husbands are, generally, looking grumpy no doubt thinking of the E700 that they have just wasted.<br /><br />Someone recently described my star grading system as somewhat wilful so I will just explain here that the three stars are an average of 5 for the singing and 0 for the production. OK I know that should make 2 ½ but Amazon does not allow fractions.",0
"Loved it - right up until the end :-/ Oh.<br /><br />I'm feeling somewhat deflated, having finished this book today. Right up until 88%, I was convinced this was the best book in the trilogy - there was so much going on, right from the start.<br /><br />But then it all went somewhat pear-shaped, in my opinion. SC tried to fit way too many things into the last few chapters; it was almost as though she was trying to bend her story to some publisher's rules. And then the Epilogue! What a complete and utter disappointment! I really, really did not like it.<br /><br />I must stress that I was neither Team Peeta, nor Team Gale. What I *can* say is that I was never Team Katniss. The main protagonist of this story did NOT enamour herself to me in any way. But I assume that was intended.<br /><br />However, what angers me the most is the similarity of this trilogy with Koushun Tukami's 'Battle Royale'. You can check it out on Amazon. Let me know what you think!",0

"don't bother! this book is terrible. jones' attempt at authenticity is patronising and reeks of a white western voice trying to inhabit the mind of a person of colour.  perhaps this is why the novel received such praise as most reviewers are not black and can fail to undertake a reading from a non-white perspective.  perhaps this is why the subtle but fundamental flaws within the novel are not detected. many novelists can occupy a culture and mindset that is not their own - that is their skill.  jones clearly does not have this talent. if you don't mind characters and a perspective that fail to come to life and feel like caricatures then go ahead and waste your time and money.  but be warned even if you do forgive the poor characterisation, dialogue and writing, the novel's ending will have you wishing you hadn't bothered anyway.",0
"Emperor's new clothes of pop music? Is it just me who doesn't get it? This is the album you see near the top of every possible all-time list. I somehow suspect that critics who wanted to appear sophisticated and intelligent desided long time ago that this is a GREAT record, and there's been a snowball effect ever since.<br /><br />My favourite Van Morrison albums are Moondance and especially St. Dominic's Preview (Redwood Tree my favourite song). In my opinion, the lengthy songs of the latter (Listen to the Lion, Independence Day) are zillion times better than the long songs of Astral Weeks.<br /><br />The listenable songs for me are Astral Weeks, Beside You, Sweet Thing, The Way Young Lovers Do (with a horrible horn solo!), and Slim Slow Rider, but even they are just ok, not among Morrison's very best. And the rest only work if I want to go to sleep fast.<br /><br />This is not the only time I disagree with other people; Neil Young's Tonight's the Night is also a record whose classic status I just can't understand (what is so great about bad singing and unfinished songs??!)<br /><br />Well, what can I say? You have been warned.",0
"Horrid The chap who likened this album to Busted hit the nail on the head, not that it sounds like Busted but the quality of &#8220;writing&#8221; and intelligence is about on par with them, in other words very run of the mill.

"More Icarus than Prometheus PROMETHEUS<br /> If you aim high - very high - you best be ready to meet expectations. The expectations for making a movie such as Prometheus are that you don't scrimp on any of the main ingredients - special effects, art direction, cinematography, music, characterisation, and plot. Ridley Scott's prequel to the Alien saga gets it right on the first three but falls short (sometimes far too much) on the latter three.<br /> Scott's return to the Alien story (a 33-year distance in release dates of his two efforts) reveals how much the director has changed his craft. His eye for detail and precision in capturing science fiction worlds has evolved finely. But his meticulousness has not carried over into demanding the best in stories and its characters. Instead of making a concerted effort to make sense of characters (flesh them out, merit their inclusion in the story), and to plug holes in a film's story by rooting out problem areas/weaknesses, Scott has frustratingly let these things slide with the result of making Prometheus, arguably one of the most eagerly awaited films of all time, a needlessly flawed film.<br /> The film's plot has a much loftier endeavour that Alien; that in itself is not a problem, but it may open up more pitfalls. It is basically concerned with the origins of mankind, so it can't really get much bigger. And why the pitfalls of Prometheus are frustrating is because they could have been pretty easily avoided. Whether it is because Scott is not too pushed about ensuring characterisation and plot are as best as can be achieved or whether he tried and just didn't get it right is one question, but one certainty is that the problems with the film are identifiable as being his responsibility (with slight exception of the sometimes ill-fitting score).<br /> This review will not run through the plot of Prometheus or offer a summary; it will merely identify some areas.<br /> The foreign world where the Prometheus story unfolds looks wonderful; it has thatgiant scope that one may want from a big budget sci-fi attempt (it looks better than worlds depicted in Avatar). The CGI and other effects are spot on. It has a lush, crisp image. One can well believe it is real. They simply look good and do the business.<br /> But there are too many characters in the movie; the time is too short to give them enough room to merit their inclusion and at least five or six are there just to be expendable in one scene. The secondary characters are weak; either formulaic or simply boring. The geologist is supposed to a bit whacky; he looks the part, but his dialogue is so trite and his strained relationship with the biologist doesn't work. Kate Dickie who plays the Ford character is quite a decent actress (those who've seen Red Road or the first season of Game of Thrones will agree) but she is a total misfire in this movie - again poor dialogue, which appears to delivered on an overdubbed track by the actress and sounds amateurish.<br />One might be tempted to think Logan Marshall-Green is not up to the task; he doesn't seem to be a serious actor, but maybe his lines and script don't do him any favours (or maybe they should have hired his doppelganger Thomas Hardy to the job instead). Noomi Rapace is a fine actress. The more you see of her the more she grows on you. She has some intense scenes and she handles them well. Her character has some silly flaws - how a talented scientist like herself still clings to a basic and juvenile Christian belief in the wake of everything she knows - but that doesn't stick out too sorely, mainly because Rapace is that good.<br />Charlize Theron is also talented but is a bit restricted in her role. If her character had better lines and one or two more scenes where we see more of who and why she is what she is, it would have worked better. And why can't she run in any direction but straight on in one particular scene at the end is just silly, but that is Scott's fault not Theron's. Idris Elba does a grandjob at a standard character; he throws in a few subtleties that you would not get with others. Guy Pearce looks ridiculous to be honest; they still haven't mastered the art of having an actor thoroughly act old when they appear (in this case ridiculously so) old.<br />Michael Fassbender is undoubtedly the star of the film; he's perfect as the disciplined and fascinated android. He throws in some nice touches here and there and he seems to be the only character the film has got just right. But a strange point of his android character, David, is that he seems to be the only one who has a patent wonder at what he sees. The others seem to just throw out \\""""oh we're in the presence of our creators\\"""" attitude as if it's a standard days work.<br />The film may be confused in its atmosphere. For example the scene where Rapace performs a procedure on herself is excellent and terrifying, worthy of any scene in Alien or landmark comparator. But that sense of terror is never really captured again, this is a real shame. In one scene where they first discover the \\""""vases\\"""" and things start to change with nefarious undertones, Rapace has to convey this while the score repeats the main title score which is far too light (almost uplifting) for that scene. That is simply a stupid mistake to make. It is repeated at the end when Rapace delivers her `last survivor' message, she's sending out a warning while the music plays light notes.<br />The \\""""Engineers\\"""" look good (they look like giant bald Trent Reznors) and in one scene we hear what they sound like, which was suitably unnerving. But on the topic of the Engineers probably the most intriguing question of the movie is why they turned on humans? Did they regret making the human species directly, or did they create other life that evolved into humans but not according to their plan? What was it about humans that they had a problem with? And at what stage of human development did they plan to destroy mankind? These fascinating aspects (which again only Rapace seems to put forward) are not delved into. Is it likely they ever will be? Will there be a sequel to Prometheus? There could be, and it wouldn't be such a bad thing as it is fascinating territory. But if there is to be a sequel I hope Scott doesn't make it. I suspect someone like Christopher Nolan (or, impossibly, Stanley Kubrick) would handle it better.<br />Finding faults aside, Prometheus is still worth the buck for reasons aforementioned (namely its look, effects, select performances, and the odd interesting sequence) and it will still make its stamp on science fiction film. Just a shame it didn't have a stricter, more perfectionist ethos behind it.<br /><br />3/5",0

"Intelligent, Captivating, Marvellous - Good Stuff Put simply, this book is a masterpiece. Usually, I tend to glance rather dubiously at books that manage to appeal to a vast audience before walking on by - Dan Brown, for instance, is 100% worthy of this treatment. However, this intelligent, perfectly sized, tense, relatable amazing novel manages to please both a large chunk of the reading population whilst also excelling critically. Every single little praise of this novel is completely true and Gillian Flynn deserves all the praise she can get for it.<br /><br />I won't be droning on about this book, about the writing, the themes, the nuances, the structure - I will say whether it's good or bad.<br /><br />The fact that I read this book in its entirety with a short break for a nap on an 8 hour flight will be able to inform you as to which of the two I lean towards.",1

The venue is great and it´s a good performance by the band (Pace is as brilliant as always; Airey is the only one who can replace the Maestro Lord; Glover is in very good shape, Gillan sings reasonnably well taking into account the years gone by since the first time he yelled on Child in Time; and Morse is fine despite a couple of non major mistakes which are surprising coming from possibly the best guitarist on earth). However, most of rock bands' performances with an orchestra end up being a bit disappointing when the orchestra is incorporated into the performance of songs that were not thought for an orchestra in the first place. The orchestra typically end up doing the same as the band does, which makes it hard to perceive or simply redundant. Perhaps Mr. Lord would have thought of a way for the orchestra to really enhace Deep Purple's songs",0

"Not worth wasting your time reading it OK so previous Dan Brown outings have provided us with fast paced action with plot twists and plenty of excitement, characters that you believe and find their actions credible....sadly that's all missing in his latest book. The similarities between The Lost Symbol and Nicholas Cage's lack lustre National Treasure are glaringly obvious in both the plot and the fact they are both awful.     The characters in this novel are unrealistic and almost pantomime like. The plot twists and puzzles we come to expect from Brown are few and far between and the story lines present aren't cohesive. Overall the book is a total let down and has obviously been written with the movie version in mind. Ultimately this book left me feeling what was the point in the plot and why had I bothered buying/reading it. Very disappointing and won't bother reading this author again.",0
"National Aeronautics and Space Agency hunts for G Bruno's worlds, not Lucretius's, so who began our modern universe? Excellent account of Poggio Bracciolini's discovery of the Lucretius MS, but an inflation of Lucretius's &#34;modernity.&#34; * I say this as a scholar of Giordano Bruno, who also wrote Lucretius-like long poems on natural philosophy (what we call &#34;science&#34;). And Bruno really did invent one main aspect of the modern; he was even burned at the stake for it. This is the idea that National Aeronautics and Space Agengy, NASA, spends $20 Billion per year to prove. Other habitable worlds. Bruno said, an &#34;Infinite number&#34; of them in his 400pp Latin poem, 1592: De Innumerabilibus, immenso & infigurabilis; seu de universo et mundis. Bruno took the modern idea that stood Aristotle on his head, Copernicus's idea of the sun as center, not the Earth, and simply applied it to other stars. Bruno read Copernicus in the mid 1570s, and with his mathematical talent (wrote 5 books on math) he understood Copernicus's spherical geometry--something I have trouble doing, despite excellent HS math with Miss Parkman of Classical HS, Springfield MA (a course in which I beat the guys going to MIT--though not in calculus the next year). And I received a National Merit Scholarship on the basis of my Math and Verbal scores--but Copernicus's spherical geometry is very difficult for me. Not for Giordano Bruno.<br />*Compare: Lucretius, &#34;necesse confiteare/ esse alios aliis terrarum in partibus orbis/ et varias hominum gentis et saecla ferrarum&#34; (II.1077-76) [since the seeds are thrown together in every place] one must confess other lands, worlds in other regions,/different kinds of men and centuries of beasts.<br />And Bruno,&#34;Eia age conscendas, statuam te in corpore Lunae,/ Aptato sensus, aptem rationis ut alas..&#34;<br />Quick now, come up with me, I'll stand you on the Moon./Fly on reason, stand on your understanding..(IV.iii.1) &#34;Iam tibi non Tellus sed vere Luna videtur,&#34; Already the Moon seems another Earth. (IV.iii.23-4)<br />In sum, Bruno ends his intro to Book IV (on Copernicus),<br />The true heavens I uphold with vast strength...<br />I uphold the Sun, and by such a star I am upheld,<br />And I hold Heaven, as I am by Heaven held in turn:<br />Thus I alone support the weight of an Atlas.<br /><br />&#34;Stellam ego substento, a stella substentor et idem,/ Et coelum teneo, a coelo tneorque vicissim:/ Ergo<br />se nostris submittant pondera Athlantis.&#34; (IV.i.41-43)",0

"Squashed As Flat As A Roadside Hedgehog I have to echo many of the previous comments about these recordings being incredibly compressed and over EQ'd in the higher frequencies.  I am all in favour of remixing old vintage tracks to give them a fresh and modern sparkle, and to correct flaws in the original mixes.  But sadly, with these recordings, that has not been achieved.    Where there is undeniably a gain in clarity, there is also a truely massive loss in dynamics, warmth and realism.  At times (for example on 'That's All') Collins's drums sound really nasty and harsh - a complete contrast from the sound on the original album's mix.  This is hardly 'progress'.    Many of us have spent our hard earned money on a decent sound system so we can enjoy our beloved music in as pristine quality as possible.  Sadly, with these productions, even nice systems just sound like cheap midi 'hi-fi's!    If you think that 'newer' automatically means 'better', then you will think these recordings now sound better.  Ditto if you think 'louder' means 'better'.  Otherwise, stick to your flawed-but-ultimately-nicer 1994 masters (which really were an improvement over the originals).",0

"Two Stars Not as good as the review suggested, in fact depressing.",0
"Open your mind This is a very stylish, high concept thriller/drama. The concept of a drug being able to tap into unused parts of your brain is an interesting one and poses many questions. Do you have to have a certain degree of intelligence in the first place? If taking this drug opens recesses of your mind you wouldnt normally use, does that mean works of art etc are invalid? How do you know its not just your awareness increasing rather than a source of intelligence? These are all questions raised by the original concept however the film follows the line of drug addicted, high flying city workers needing their regular fix to keep them buzzing!<br /><br />At first the film takes steps in a more intelligent thought provoking direction. However, whilst still engaging the tale ulitmately becomes a drug abuse story and the consequences of these actions. Bradley Cooper was excellent and really managed the change from down and out to suave city slicker brilliantly well. In fact he is the saving grace of the film. Without him the story would have floundered and struggled to find its feet. Robert De Niro continues his decline into obscurity. Although not a bad performance it was certainly non-descript and didnt have the threat a character like his so badly needed.<br /><br />Limitless is an enjoyable light weight thriller which chooses a slightly more simple and conventional route than it could have done and adheres to some basic thriller staples. Its a well paced, generally well acted and stylish movie which will get you thinking, but more along the lines of what could have been!",0

"Not as good as the original but...... Now before anyone starts to moan or complain (I'm thinking of an individual in NZ) I will say that the film should be judged for what it is, rather than be compared to the original.  Whilst being a prequel and at times it feels like a remake due to some scenes being almost identical to the Carpenter classic, it is entertaining for the most part.  Only during the final 20 minutes does the film start to flag.    Fair play to those in charge of the creature effects.  The mixture of cgi and models is very impressive apart from one ropey moment.  Whilst nothing radically different from the original, they stay faithful to their source material.  The film offers very little which is original etc but it still comes out looking more impressive than most recent horror films.  The film features a large cast enabling the creature to carve up and absorb plenty of people however it lacks the tension and the killer soundtrack an atmosphere.  The story is pretty straight forward, Norwegians find a huge ship buried in the ice along with the creature.  The man in charge of the dig is only interested in making history and keeping his find for himself and pretty soon everything goes wrong. Thus we have the few hours leading up to the classic 1980's film.   Enjoy the film on its own merits rather than make a comparison otherwise you might not like what you see.",0
"Pressure points. One for the collector. This live album by Camel who, for those who don't know, were a progressive, gentle rock band through the '70's and onwards fronted by Andrew Latimer(under rated to say the least.)Camel was noted for unusual key signatures and longer melodic pieces and for having so many line up changes it was often hard to keep pace. Read about them online! This CD is a well played look at a particular album, Stationary Traveller, with a hark back to some of their earlier work. I have followed Camel from the outset and have seen them perform many times. This album reflects admirably what they were like onstage. Really worth a listen if you like the genre! Even better, this CD is also available as a DVD,and, although the visual quality isn't fantastic, the sound track is spot on.Well worth a look.",0
"A potentially interesting tale that never really burst into life I'd been looking forward to reading this book for ages, having seen it recommended on a number of sites. It sounded like the sort of thing I'd love - I'm a big fan of modern fantasy and as a sometime scholar of Renaissance Italy, the pseudo-Venetian setting sounded fascinating. Sadly, I was quite disappointed and found I really had to make an effort to get through the book, which is really unusual for me.<br /><br />The infuriating thing wasn't that it was terrible, but rather that it felt as though there was a good story trying to burst out through some fairly long, drawn out plotting. I forced myself to read on, certain that the plot was going to burst into life at any moment. Every so often, potentially interesting elements were introduced: \\""""oh, there are ancient magical structures left by a previous race - maybe there's going to be a great revelation about them,\\"""" or \\""""ah,the hero has a mysterious ex-girlfriend who he can't get over - I guess she'll be showing up soon to wreck havoc.\\"""" In both these cases and several more however, the matter was just let drop. The Elderglass towers seem to be mere window dressing, the ex-girlfriend never appears and the reader is never told anything about her.<br /><br />At times, I felt myself finally getting interested in the story, only to be rudely interrupted by one of the \\""""Interludes\\"""" - chapters explaining something about the history of Camorr or about the main characters' training. Some of these were interesting, others not so much, but in almost all cases, they seemed to horribly break the flow of the main plot. I actually really like non-linear narratives when they are done well and I'm usually a fan of back story about the mythos of fantasy worlds, but for whatever reason, I didn't feel they worked here. It just felt a bit self-indulgent, as though the author wanted to show that he'd created a fully developed world. Some could have been lost completely, others weaved more naturally into the story, perhaps by having them all at the beginning or having one character tell another the story.<br /><br />To be fair, there is some good stuff. The setting is an unusual one and works rather well. Some of the characters are appealing (especially the villains I thought) and certain elements of the plot quite interesting. I read the last third in one sitting - this seemed to have the action and revelations that were missing earlier on and made me think that maybe I'll give the sequel a chance after all. Nonetheless, I'm struggling to see just what it is that led to all the five star reviews.<br /><br />Interestingly, this series always seems to be mentioned in the same breath as Joe Abercrombie's books, which I've also found difficult to get into despite seemingly near universal rave reviews. So if you liked those, you'll probably love this, if not, maybe give it a miss.or having one character tell another the story.  To be fair, there is some good stuff.

"What a disappointment! If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is...I wouldn't have bought a book with the title \\""""15 minute meals\\"""" if I had endless amounts of time to cook, so what I expected to find were simple and tasty recipes with few ingredients that could actually be produced in 15 minutes. I am sure this is possible, but clearly not with the recipes in this book. Most recipes have a long list of ingredients, not all of which can be easily found in your local supermarket/corner shop. They may take 15 minutes to cook, once you have done the shopping and made the preparations AND you are using the expensive appliances recommended in the book, which, incidentally, take ages to clean after use and clutter up your kitchen.I haven't actually tried any of the recipes yet, they may still be delicious, however,I estimate the actual cooking time for each of them to be around 1 hour, or 45 minutes at best. Really, not a cookbook for working mums!",0

Five Stars As brilliant an album as you would expect from THE MASTER,1
"It is really something after all, huh? It's really something, I suppose.<br /><br />What's its real merit? It is. That it is. I, having seen it, do confirm that is.<br /><br />I just don't know if it means anything more than dust in your eyes, in the end. Despite, of course, that it knows and knows you know it knows that, in the end.<br /><br />Cinematography is award winning kind of stuff, everything is apt and avoids both blandness and overkill. The winner about this film is probably the latter part, that it is not afraid to use both very everyday kind of cinematography that works, and also even the nearly deadpan in cinematography, which happens to emphasise the human element very well. (Even where there is nearly nothing going on, humanly. To be kind I can say it's a great example of economy used to substantive effect. To be less kind I can wonder if you're being fooled by that very technique, fooled that there is indeed substance there. And, again, if that is the point in this wry, postmodern, self consciously, maybe mockingly arty thriller.)<br /><br />The rewarding visual impact of the clever cinematography with editing and pacing and a lot of extremely, extremely fine acting skills and directing and technical work, what is (whatever it is, if its anything more than naught) is a very fine looking classic of a production. Stunning. Brilliant. Faultless. Soulful.<br /><br />With those last words as adjectives to a describing term of essence, for the life of me I just can't think what the true descriptive term would be. Soulful what? Dust in your eyes? Only? For the soul of this film also reminds of me soulful suggesting, soulless worlds, for example of Brett Easton Ellis's \\""""The Informers\\"""" (I wasn't thinking of the film of that book). I suppose \\""""Drive\\"""" had a vision of, in part, going further than Ellis's world of the ice cold, perhaps living dead soul (in part as it also attempts to let a human, warm element be apparent), as I suppose the main element of \\""""Drive\\"""" may be the caricature of the modern story, especially the film story, and how it may have eaten up real life.<br /><br />I'm hungry and I need a bite to eat as nature takes over from becoming lost in an artificial existence of searching for anything of substance which that film is, to describe it (beyond that it is, as I've said, really something, I suppose.) It seems very significant that the basic urge to throw away analysis of the film and have a real bite to eat wins more or less instantly, with no doubt lingering. Yet, I've watched the film numerous times and, as long as I live, will return to experience its visual and aural experience.<br /><br />That's a good deal better than \\""""Top Gun\\"""", at least. I remember the 2nd time I saw that film saying as seriously as I could, looking like a military pledge, \\""""I will return to this film through the years and I will watch it.\\"""" But it was practised though, and followed my mocking, earlier joke pledge through hysterical laughter. The later one with grins expelled and sniggers shown true order was made as I realised it's not the kind of film you can escape in any event, and would be shown numerous times a year, especially when you are stuck indoors with no options. Hell, what else is \\""""Top Gun\\"""", on the level? You got bone-all else on.<br /><br />That pledge was joked, I rarely accepted sitting through \\""""Top Gun\\"""" after and always hoped I'd never have to ever again, and largely haven't.<br /><br />\\""""Drive\\"""": I don't know, I might regret it, but I will come back to its staged, referenced, ice cold, dead cold studiedness even though I don't know why. Maybe for the technique, as a contrast to culture which overwhelmingly prescribes that you support the emotions (or emotiveness, more likely) and spirit. In this minimalist way, it can be a good, soulful watch. On the other hand, it is very poised conceptually, staged and maybe faked seeming and it's not hard to wonder \\""""who cares\\"""" and if the makers were thinking exactly that. While I did consider giving this film 2 stars at one point, which I wouldn't now, I wouldn't stretch to 4, I think.<br /><br />I'm not saying I don't hate this film. I do. I hate it. I revile nearly all of its (intentionally) disgusting essence. I'm repelled by the lowest common denominator film making becoming a photogenic, expertly stitched fabric quilt (not the unslick patchwork variety, understand) which itself manages to send up the very nature of modern film in nearly every scene. It's an anti-film, if anything. So scathingly sardonic while incredibly self-obsessed, so wryly lambasting modern film context, you can't even say it's laughing at you. For it finished choking its belly with laughter at you even just before the very moment it came into your head to watch it (or maybe long before).<br /><br />The music, the killer music which appeals controllingly, subtly to the base, good, sexual vibrations in a person (particularly \\""""A Real Hero\\"""", the ambivalent La Gaurdia plnae crash pilot tribute) I hate. I hate the way the music and the film and the music's use in the film steps upon and erases my love of genuineness in culture, for example drowning out the memory of \\""""Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart\\"""" by Alicia Keys. It tramps over and eradicates the knowledge of that whole world.<br /><br />... Ok, ok. Which is its point. I hate the film, but it does have you by its claws because it works, logically, as a postmodern comment about society and film. It works, yes the *** works.<br /><br />I just feel sorry for the people who bought it on face value, as an action - crime thriller. It's the biggest pastiche, or spoof, of those that has ever been made, probably.",0

"World´s Fastest Film Ending? For great cinematography, costumes and acting this is your film.  For character development, adaption to screenplay, direction and editing please do not waste your money.  My wife walked out on this one half-way through but I stuck with it only to find the ending, which should have been about an hour of story-line, condensed into about 30 seconds.  Was there a last minute budget cut while shooting?  I can picture a team in the editing room frantically trying to finish before the next light bill was due!  I plan to read the book again just to purge the film from my mind.",0

"Worth a watch Not much connection to the real Dracula who nailed people's hats to their heads. One invading army allegedly turned back in terror when they found themselves in one of his &#34;forests&#34; made up of people he'd spiked. Dracula Untold shows him as a family man, trying to do what he can for his family and people, I know it's a movie and well, yes. Luke Evans is a great actor and great to see Paul Kaye as well, but overall, while it's worth a watch, I can't say I'd recommend it. Francis Ford Coppola's version is much better even though it had Gary Oldman playing up on the human side too, sorry guys, I'm used to getting furious responses to some of my postings but the point of a review is saying what you think, this movie is ok, but not that great.",0
Five Stars Very Good its a pity this was not released years ago well done for bringing this out,1
"Back seat running. Well, I liked this and I didn't like this.    I run as do many other reviewers on here and I wanted to hear someone elses take on it and how running has progressed for them and maybe what it means to them too. Running itself is a little insane, though it gives back its not without initial pain to get into things- I have not heard anyone, even a professional runner, not mention the no-pain-no-gain issue even if only in passing through to mention something else, if it was easy, everyone would run without question and injuries caused by running would be far less then they are today.    I liked Murakami for being open and honest, if a little too.....vague at times, he talks about many things which seem to me like boasting and likes to remind us (almost constantly) that he does not do things for competative reasons nor for bettering other people or battling, yet runs a lot and sure likes you to know this! I'd say at the very least he does compete with himself and seems to feel a great deal of failure if he doesn't achieve his goals. Nothing wrong with that, I feel bad if I haven't achieved the aims I set out to do when running/exercising but I don't state over and over again that I don't do things to compete or better others. Obviously I do have a degree of healthy competative nature within me same as Murakimi and maybe he just hasn't come to terms with this yet!    I found the descriptions of a failing body very depressing, its nice to read he is still running but sad to see the effects of age on his running but on reading back, I wonder how much of his problems are totally down to age. He makes it clear early on in the book that he doesn't 'do' stretching. He can't be bothered with it it would seem. He visits a massuse and mentions how much he values doing so and continues to see someone more then once so its obviously of value to see someone about the tightness he has found his muscles in, but it does sound like alot of his issues are brought about bu refusing to aidhis body to recover after running rather then age alone.     I think this book is a bit like the descriptions I head of opinion: its neither right nor wrong, it just is. Its important to bear this in mind I think when reading this book: there are many parts of this book which have me even as an amature runner, squeem in horror at what he puts his body through when he clearly refuses to allow it time to recover, but this never did set out to be a set of lifestyle instructions, it was just a personal statement on someones life at several points in reflection.",0
"What have I bought? Many people recommended The Elements of Style, but have I made a mistake buying this publication?   This edition is written by William Strunk, Jr only, he wrote the original version 1918.  E.B. White updated the book in 1959 and wrote several subsequent editions expanding on the original text.  The other clue that this book is not up to date is a statement inside the cover saying - Filiquarian Publishing, LLC is publishing this edition of Elements of Style, due to its public domain status.  So is this version a publication of William Strunk's original version?  If so, (I kind of feel like I have been duped) I wish I had brought the updated and expanded version.  It is probably worth spending the extra money for the 50th Anniversary version because at least you know what you are buying.    I have also noted that reviews for this publication are exactly the same as the Strunk & White 1999 edition, this is deceiving as you perceive them as the same book.    I have given this publication two stars because, despite the above, I have learnt a bit.",0

"Fails as entertainment Fails as entertainment. Fails for inclusion in the best of World literature. I won’t be keeping this book for my library.<br /><br />She can write but she does not entertain. The author’s trail is scented by a plastic fox – there is no real danger. The disjointed English of Boris caused me to suffer for at least 500 pages of this 771 page novel.<br /><br />Grief and suffering lie at the centre of the author’s submission. I have often wondered how American authors working through the 9/11 disaster could remain tuned to their book projects and this book throws light on grief and suffering after a bombing incident where the hero loses his mother in a NY museum. As a female author the choice to inhabit a young 13 year old boy posed difficulties - dialogue  - and as her hero aged there were comfort areas where the author chose not take the reader – no sex scenes, no record of sexual contact. This was a little strange since the characters and plot involve enforcers, NY / Vegas /Amsterdam pond life, medication and criminality.<br /><br />Research 2/10 – The theft of the goldfinch painting by Carel Fabritius central to the novel is the only track worthy of pursuit.<br />Prose and Pace 3/10 – Pace is hampered by too much use of the hyphen. She jabs it everywhere and when this is accompanied with immigrant ‘Sprache’ and spelling – reading ceased to be enjoyable.<br />History and Politics 0/10<br /><br />Humour Poetry – I did not find any humour and nothing of merit to report.<br /><br />Product placement is in evidence – Turnbull and Asser – I have owned one of their beautiful suits. However I think it was the poke at the Catholic Church which cost Donna the Bailey’s 2014 Women’s prize for fiction. It was that moment when children in Catholic school uniforms were seen to pull their father out of a seedy bar.<br /><br />This is a long book, I would have been happy to have put it aside after 200 pages; it was limp and although the plot and its objective suggested promise, the immigrant character’s ‘Sprache’ killed enjoyment. Just like Fabritius’s Goldfinch tethered to its feeder, for this review I was involuntarily tethered to Tartt’s book – ‘Scheisse.’",0

"pretty uninspired This is a tough one to call cos i love scott gorham and im really glad hes still out there blasting away. But this album, though rocking and very well-produced, smacks of a little bit of desperation to me<br /><br />ok - first off - brian downey and his tom-oriented drumming (my favourite ever drummer by the way) is sadly missed here. What we have instead is very predicatable and unimaginative 4/4 drumming patterns throughout. The real issue though is with ricky warwick. When hes not cloning phil lynott in his singing style hes sounding like gary moore. And when i say 'sounding like' i not only mean in his vocal itself but also in terms of phrasing, melody and structure. After a while this mike-yarwood-style impersonation/s starts to grate a bit. The man has no identity of his own here.<br /><br />The songs? theyre ok. pretty standard riff-a-rama though, nothing really to make you sit up and go 'wow'. The problem is, they all sound like thin lizzy or gary moore out-takes, except that the lizzy material especially was a hell of a lot stronger than whats on offer here<br /><br />I dunno - like i said, im glad to see gorham out there and i wish him and his band all the success he can handle. But theres something depressing about this album",0

"Thankfully Brief After seeing the hype around the film associated with this book and having a close friend recommend it as one of her favourite books of all time, I was disappointed to be left with a rather blaze feeling after reading it myself.  The concept of the book is sound enough, but I felt for the most part that I was reading a GCSE English/History assignment designed to make the average and not so average 14 year old think about the world around them more.  The child it focuses around is supposed to be 9 years old, yet is remarkably uninquisitive for a child of his age and who explores his surroundings; never connecting the dots or even coming to any substantial conclusion about any matter.   The also quite astounding idea that the 9 year old son of a high ranking Nazi officer would not be in the Hitler Youth programme is frankly close to absurd. A nine year old in his position would have been reaming fascist prose, even if it was not truly understood.  All in all I found the book badly if not completely un-researched, which was disappointing as the potential was there for a truly stunning piece of literature.",0

"Oh, dear :-( Remember when web-cams first hit the UK? They took pretty bad pictures, and even worse videos, but we loved them because a whole new world had opened up. We could actually *see* each other when we chatted online. It was kind of like when cameras started gracing our mobile phones, but if you wanted a really good picture then you still needed a camera. Nowadays our phones can take every bit as good a picture as a camera, they're a lot less tedious to carry around, and we wouldn't go back to our old ways for love nor money.<br /><br />Well, this little camera in our oh-so-lovely Fire HDs has allowed us to drop back to the late nineties and make us glad that we've come so far. My advice? Wait for the next best thing for the Fire. Some bright spark will come along and set things to rights with the camera, which will then not only be a much better application, but may well eliminate the need for phone cameras (okay, that might be taking it a bit far, but you never know!)

"This book made me so sad that only my soul could do the crying. Sob sob. I'm surprised that there aren't more middle of the road reviews here. Essentially, it's a real page-turner in parts, and makes you cringe with embarrassment and/or curse the author in others. The problems for me really are the ridiculous prose, the pretentious and meaningless philosophies of the author and his initial crew of friends, and the author's ridiculously high opinion of himself and obsession with the need to constantly reinforce what an amazing individual he is. The plus points are the scope of the story, and the fact that somehow it keeps you coming back for more despite all its flaws.  The story can be gripping at times, though the strings of coincidences may go a little too far for some. There are endless sections that segue into another through a chance encounter; it seems there are only a handful of people in Mumbai. There are also some likable characters, mostly locals rather than his idiotic expat friends. Prabaker in particular keeps things moving along with a chuckle, especially in the early stages. That said, individuals in this are presented in the great Eurocentric tradition of both constantly romanticising and valorising some illusory exoticism, whilst managing to be immesely patronising at the same time.  The narrative chugs along at an irregular pace, with, for example, a whole chapter on one fairly dull night in a bar, followed by another swiftly galloping through fires, a career as a doctor an encounter with a sword-wielding mentalist etc. There is always something just around the corner though, which keeps you going through the dull or outright infuriating bits.  But now on to the key aspect to just about everything that is wrong with this book - the central protagonist. The David Brent figure suggested elsewhere here really is quite apt, but without any of the insecurities and human flaws that make him somehow likable. He utterly adores himself and we wants to let you know that opinion is clearly shared by everyone he meets. Someone described this book as the world's longest love letter to one's self, and that really does sum it up. It's reflected in so many ways, not least his constant references to how amazing people think he is for learning some Marathi and Hindi. As an Englishman who's lived in India for over 4 years now, I can testify to the fact that they are not difficult languages to learn at all. Indeed, in my years here I've met countless foreigners who are constantly trying to prove how well they 'get' India, and what a true local they've become. Mr Roberts is like all of them combined into one massive walking ego, enshrouded in a cloak of shameless Orientalism. Many would say that personal opinions about the author/protagonist are missing the point, he is apparently a character after all no? Unfortunately for me his character does not act to challenge or precipitate reflection, and these flaws do not seem to warrant consideration of anything other than the fact that they really do seem to be a simple reflection of the author's deep self-regard.  The endless cod philosophy and ridiculous prose are also utterly maddening. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and even pages when the protagonist or his core group of friends wibbled their cringe-worthy musings on the meaning of truth, or the nature of change. His own personal fatalistic philosophies are also a hilariously thinly veiled attempt to justify dubious choices on the grounds of some deeper truth (he preaches, for example, that every attempt to ameliorate a given situation will always exacerbate it).  The prose too, good lord the prose. Yes, that line in the title of my review contains a partial quote (it's actually that &#34;some things are so sad that only your soul can do the crying&#34;); and yes it did make me laugh out loud even to type that here again. His particular obsession is describing colour, particularly eye colour, in as ridiculous a way as is humanly possible. I genuinely think he sat down for a couple of days and wrote a list of descriptions for every possible hue and shade of the rainbow, and then proceeded to force them, screaming. into the book.  One such example:  &#34;His eyes were the colour of sand.&#34; (ok, no problem so far) &#34;In the palm of your hand.&#34; (Hmmm) &#34;A few mintues before the sun goes down.&#34;. I had to put the book down and curse aloud at that point.  They really should have produced two versions. A heavily edited version for normal people, and this version for the spiritual pop-psychology generation who think that anything that has made it to print, and that purports to be intellectual must have some underlying meaning. In many ways, I think this book is basically an effort in self-valorisation and ego enhancement with a story written around it.  So why did I give it 3/5 and not 1 or 2. Well I did finish it despite utterly loathing the core protagonist and at least 50% of the dialog. That's got to count for something. I think I'm giving it an extra star or so as it challenges the reader's persistence and belief that somehow it will all turn out to be ok and he'll be revealed as a parody.",0

Excellent condition 5 stars for condition of book. It looks like new. I've not read all the book yet as it is a substantial read.

What I've read so far makes quite a bit of sense but whether I will be able to cut out wheat altogether will be a challenge but having tried the Atkins diet years ago I know it works.,1
"Compelling yet lackluster. First and foremost, Maze Runner is fundamentally a young persons book. Its incredibly easy to read and gets to the point quickly with major plot points being unfolded in only a few pages. Except for this I am going to write a summary of what i think of the book from my perspective.<br /><br />Picking the book up for the first time the writing immediately felt simple and/or lazy - the vocabulary is basic and descriptions vague at best. Obviously the author's soul intention was to deliver a story and to a certain extent he achieved that goal. The worst thing about this novel is probably the pacing. The beginning stages last a while and consist of Thomas (the protagonist) repetitively complaining and getting in a bad mood which is fundamentally boring to read. However whenever any action occurs the author cant wait to be rid of it, especially towards the end. Supposedly huge events are brushed over and forgotten about within a single chapter, instead he focuses on what Thomas is feeling in a quite obscure way. Quite often you find yourself reading page after page of 'thomas was too tired to talk so ate and slept' which seems entirely unnecessary. These moments dont do anything to flesh out the character but certainly flesh out the feeling of wasted time whilst reading.<br /><br />At the end of the day most people read novels for a good story and the Maze Runner's story is certainly not bad. Its full of mystery and inquiry and bravery and death. Sadly its all delivered through the lenses of 'teenage writing' and thus overall it suffers. A good book for people within the ages of 11-15.",0

"Rock this town! First of all, I should probably thank a guy called Tom Graham for introducing me to this band, as well as other rock n roll like the great Eddie Cochran. He thought that these guys were the greatest band in the world, which I have to disagree with and I think that Eddie is twice as good as these guys.  Anyway - the album! Before I purchased this album from this site I had only heard 2 Stray cats tracks, 'Rock this town' and 'Stray cat strut'. They are still my 2 favourite Stray cats songs and are definetly the best they have. Rock this town is the best - it's just so upbeat and it rocks! Whereas Stray cat strut is a cool number for cool people and it's far slower, but it is a great song.   I know that a lot of people think that Setzer was and is the greatest rock n roll guitarist of all time, but I have to disagree. Eddie Cochran was one of Brian's heroes and I think he is twice the guitarist as Brian. His music is also nearly twice as good as Stray cats. You don't wanna hear that though do you!? Cochran was part of the original rock n roll revolution and was walking in the footsteps of Elvis Presley, whereas Stary cats were trying to re-new rock n roll and make it appeal to their generation and youngsters. The result is evident and give me the original any day.   Other great songs on this album are 'You don't believe me','Storm the embassy, 'Something's wrong with my radio' and 'Too hip, gotta go' as well as 'Rumble in Brighton'. I was expecting a different sound from them, so I would definetly not say that they are the greatest band of the 80's but they are one of them! My other favoourite 80's band is The Police, so if you like older music then I would definetly reccomend buying their greatest hits album first. The Police are twice the band these guys are, but I guess that's just my tastes. Andy Summers is definetly a better guitarist as well - well the whole band has more talent actually! I do know though, that Sting is more than twice the songwriter that Setzeris and that's why he made it big going solo and Setzer never did go solo.   Some songs to look out for are 'I won't stand in your way', which is a ballad. If a band usually do rock n roll tunes then they definitely shopuldn't try a smoochy ballad like this. The final track on the album is 'Drink that bottle down', whcih is a live version, although it doesn't say so. Brian's vocals are terrible and it all sounds a bit shaky. The guitar sounds good though, but I would've preferred a normal version of this song or a different song. This album is mostly quality but there are some tracks that are weaker than the others. If you want meaningful and emotional then this isn't the band for you but if you like straight up re-newed rock n roll then this is the album that you will enjoy.   The stray cats are definetly the second best band of the 80's and it's no wonder why they did so well in the U.K. It would be nice if they got back together to make a new album - but what's the chance of that!? Get this album and you surely won't regret it, unless you only like my two favourite songs of theirs. I would definetly reccomend buying The Police first, but if you prefer rockabilly to rock, then you would definetly see greatness in this album. Thanx for reading!",0

An old foe named Joker wants a reunion and he is worse then ever and stop at nothing to get what he wants. The Feds want the Man of Steel or Superman to put a stop to him. Even if it means to put and end to him once and for all.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the idea of story, but it just left me empty, they promised something new or something that the audience wasn't expecting but every action that happens doesn't come unexpected, even when it was the first time I looked at it I knew exactly what was happening and how it will end, it felt like it was too pushed forward and just finished it because people wanted to see the 2nd part because of all the excitement from the first part.<br /><br />This is a small nit pick but since when has the Joker been a Ken Doll? He Looks really good, Batman & Catwoman and the others has grown old but Joker hasn't got old a bit, years been kind to him or the animators just forgot.<br /><br />The ending or the epic battle between Batman and Superman is what I'm most disappointed with. Feels too much Hollywood ending, SPOILER ALERT but the most disappointing moment is when Alfred dies, he has been the butler who took care of Bruce Wayne and here his death is treated as nothing happened, just left him dead, no remorse, no sad moment, just he get a heart attack and die  and nothing more, not even Bruce Wayne say something about it at the end, like forgive me Alfred or thank you for everything Alfred but nothing, and that's a serious flaw.<br /><br />So sorry but this movie did not please but my verdict is......See it, because after all it is the ending of Dark Knight returns and there are some parts in this film worth watching.",0
"Boring 50 times over I have all of Kate Bush`s albums apart from the recent re-hash which I ignored and quite frankly,I wish I had ignored this one too.  50 Words For Snow is very boring and I have to start from track 4 as the first three songs go on way too long and way too slowly aswell.  I wonder if a record company would have released this album if it was done by a new up and coming artist?...I doubt it!  Art is of course subjective and some people find an arranged pile of old tyres artistic...I dont however... Give me  any of her other albums anyday, but not this one.  I do have one bit of praise however.The mastering level bucks the usual ridiculous trend of turning everything up to the max and killing the dynamic range.The mastering engineer definitely wasn`t trying to win the Loudness War and It`s a shame there are not more about like him/her/them.Most modern cd`s are ruined by bad mastering and new vinyl isn`t much better either as usually the compressed cd master is used  with the volume reduced a little  to stop the stylus jumping out of the groove.For that I commend this album,it`s just unfortunate I dont like the music.",0

"disappointing On 31 Mai I pre-ordered this item, with high expectations, because I liked their first album \\""""Together\\"""" so much. I played sometimes that album a couple of times per day.

Jonathan solo's could have done better and I think he can do better. So what went wrong? I like Charlotte's solo's , but the whole album , I cann't get no connection with it, although I give it a good try.<br />First I gave this album a 3 star, especially due to Charlotte's solo's, but I re-rate it with a 2 star, that album is simply not that good.<br />For a great part I  agree with \\""""Lindwurm\\"""" and \\""""jms\\"""". .<br /><br />As much as I do love J & C and their voices as well as their beautiful friendship, to their second CD I say I don't like it with exception of some songs. In its total aspect as \\""""jms\\"""" stated for me also to cheesy.  Sorry to say.  Hope their next album will be much better.",0

"Phenomenal I purchased this album back in May 2014 (Now January 2015) and thought I should share how amazing this album is. I was never a huge fan of music, and although I knew who MJ was, I'd never shown an interest in his music, but after hearing a hit from the Xscape album on the radio and deciding I liked it I thought I'd take a listen to his greatest songs buy purchasing this album.<br /><br />I was hooked straight away and had it on repeat 24/7, having never really taken an interest to music at all it was wonderful to experience all of these songs in detail for the first time. Even my mum cannot help but enjoy it and she isn't the biggest MJ fan. Every song has something in it which makes it unique to listen to, I cannot say which is my favourite because it is simply too difficult to decide, there is a song which fits every mood. All I can say is that I'm disappointed I never took an interest when I was younger.<br /><br />Since purchasing this album I went on to buy Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, Invincible and Xscape and the only complaint I can have is that the Essentials album doesn't contain enough of his fantastic work! (Obviously there is an exception for the Xscape album). To me this suggests it's a great starting point for his music, there is a great combination of tracks from all his albums and the best hits when performing as the Jackson 5 and the Jacksons.<br /><br />I would recommend this collection of songs to anybody because they really are outstanding - To think one artist did all this work is amazing. I am sure not even the biggest MJ fans would be gripped to it and like me, go on to build a collection of his work and become a fan.",1
my horse I think this Game is a really good for children to show want to learn how to look after a horse for fugure.<br />Even adults like this Game you need a lot of patience for this game.

"not what i expected It should have been great, but instead reinforced in me the knowledge that a film will never substitute real life. I found myself having absolutely no connection with any of the characters (which is odd considering the parallels) and actually disliked every character in the film. You need to see a film like this to let you know how much you appreciate more mainstream dialogue !<br /><br />I bet this film seemed great in the director's head - I had great expectations from reading the plot, but I think for me at least, the story needs to be read as a book to make it work - I could not get to grips with the imagery, none of it matched my own experiences or visual experiences apart from the white noise/static bit upon death. So when a two hour film only provides one shot that I can connect to and that happens to be a nearly pure white screen with completely abstract sound effects - it's not the film I thought it would be !! Two stars because a lot of effort has gone into this and the idea is great and ambitious.",0

"Possibly one of the better books on the subject I found Joy of Home Brewing somewhat disappointing, despite its being widely praised. While the book does contain a great deal of useful information, it's poorly organised, often unclear, and occasionally simply wrong - for instance, despite Papaziani's assertion to the contrary, the fact that liquids decrease in density with temperature is unrelated to the decrease in viscosity that occurs when viscous liquids are warmed. Moreover, the author often fails to make clear distinctions between various devices or process under discussion, forcing the reader to re-read a passage several times to make sense of what it is being said. Finally, Papaziani's attempts at being light-hearted or clever generally fall quite flat, contributing nothing to either the readability or the entertainment value of his book. Indeed, there were times when I felt that if I read his inane catchphrase \\""""relax, have a home brew!\\"""" one more time, I'd surely scream and toss the volume into the nearest waste bin. All this having been said, the book is not a bad place to begin with a home-brewing hobby, and does contain sufficient information that it's worth having around, simply as a reference, even for the seasoned brewer.<br /><br />An Addendum....<br />I've now had Papazian's book for about two years, and I have to confess that my regard for it and its author has grown considerably during that period of time. JHB has now become the reference I'm most likely to turn to first if a brewing question arises, and the one I'm most likely to recommend to friends considering taking up the hobby. Overall, I've found the facts, tables, and figures to be impeccably correct, and points mentioned above where I assert otherwise can probably be attributed to matters of interpretation arising from Papazian's indefatigably casual style. I should say that the overall, chapter-by-chapter organization of the manuscript is one of the best I've seen, it's only at the paragraph and sentence level that the flow of ideas occasionally becomes less than crystal-clear. I still find the flippant style not to my personal taste, however, though the concepts and facts thus presented are nonetheless well-researched, even scholarly. Were I to re-review book at this point, I would most likely now give it four, possibly even five stars.",0
Five Stars Always a favourite,1
"Good to very good singers The advantages of this CD are the singers and the orchestra. The disadvantages are the sound quality, the lack of information about the singers, conductor and time. The sound appears dry, as if coming out of a box. That is a pity because the singers deserved better as they are all good or very good. Some of them have problems with their German pronunciation, however.<br />Margareta Hallin as &#34;Königin der Nacht&#34; is sensationally good. She has exemplary coloratura and absolutely pure top notes. World class! If you want to listen to more of her I recommend the CD called &#34;Margareta Hallin, The Early Recordings&#34; (Bluebell). The first track is &#34;Una voce poco fa&#34; from &#34;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&#34;. The aria is stunningly performed and according to me one of the best I have ever heard.

"A little disappointing. I'm not aiming for an in-depth review here, I just wanted to share how I also was quite disappointed with this. I was really intrigued by the premise of traditional folklore characters living in a gritty city setting, and how this would be expressed in graphic novel form. I did think there were plenty of great character ideas, particularly the development (or breaking down) of the relationships between all the \\""""happy couples\\"""" such as Beauty and the Beast and Snow White and Prince Charming. There's lots clever little details like this that twist and subvert our familiar conceptions of fairytales (Solinas' review offers a thorough summary), and these did encourage me to keep reading through the whole thing. But I thought the story was tedious and dull - there's all this possibility for something totally unique, and all this intrigue surrounding these characters, but it turns out to be just another murder mystery, nothing much better than the average episode of CSI! I also would have liked slightly more interesting, varied and stylised illustrations, but that's just a matter of personal preference as I feel this way about a lot of comic art.<br /><br />I'm aware that more of the history will probably be revealed in the other volumes, but I just thought it was a little strange to start such an intriguing series with this story, although it's worth a read to see the amusing little details that hark back to our childhood bed-time stories.",0

"Terrible I won't repeat everything that's been said by previous 'one star' reviewers, but just wanted to say how glad I am to have found this review section, as, having read the book to see what all the fuss is about, was wondering if I'm the only sane person in a world gone utterly mad. A world where the Guardian can't stop falling over itself to bang on about this book, a world where this pile of abject drivel will become a huge movie starring famous people who surely know how embarrassingly bad it's going to be but will none the less keep the money machine rolling on.<br /><br />Anyway, thank you fellow one star reviewers, for your well written and at times hilarious reviews, which have been much more fun and life enhancing than the book itself.",0
"A modern classic This is such a solid book with a well-told story and characters that engage the reader right from the off. Nicholls really knows how to draw out a love story and pepper it with just the right amount of funny/emotional scenes to keep you interested. His use of such a clever and unique plot device - reviewing Emma and Dexter's lives and how they've changed on a certain day every year - is really original and yet so simple that it is easily relateable.<br /><br />If you're a fan of 'When Harry Met Sally', then you'll love 'One Day'.

Good album for the new younger fans so who just want the hits.,0
"What film is this the score for then? This is a rather remarkably unremarkable album but nontheless listenable to, although with its collection of mainly short unrelated instrumental tracks reminds me of the film score albums 'More' and 'Obscured by Clouds' of '69 and '72 respectively which were ok as it goes, but also sounded like a lot of out takes and filler material. There are also hints of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', Atom Heart Mother' and 'Saucerful of Secrets' without ever coming close to capturing the majesty of those pieces of music. I'll give it 3 stars because it isn't absolutely dreadful and is a nice undemanding sounding album to play in the car.",0
"Machinations of a Mystery Zodiac tells the story - and every wild goose chase in-between - of the hopeless, hapless search for a blundering killer in 1970s San Francisco. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the obsessive newspaper artist Robert Grayson, an internet geek for a pre-internet age.<br /><br />Once you're locked into the rhythm of Zodiac's short, dense scenes, throbbing like a steady heartbeat, you're kind of mesmerised. But ultimately it's an experience as maddening, detailed, demanding and repetitive as the obsession it depicts. 160 minutes is a long time to be locked in a labyrinth from which there may be no escape.<br /><br />Zodiac really is devoted to its story. However, its determination not to stray from the evidence means that the domestic and inter-cop conflicts come across as mechanised. Chloe Sevigny plays the wife to Gyllenhaal's hair-tearing sleuth - but she plays it with flat indifference, so one is never convinced that she truly wants to drag Graysmith away from his books, least of all Mr Fincher.<br /><br />Ruffalo delivers the film's (and his personal) best performance. As professionalism gives way to disillusionment, and then morphs into frustration and finally ambivalence, his detective inspector is the struggle at the centre of the mystery, while colleagues drop out and cartoonists plunge yet deeper.<br /><br />The film's aesthetic is largely handsome and static, occasionally interrupted by virtuoso aerial pans and tracks, as if Fincher wants to position the story as lost in a city of stories (a point made rather more concisely in Psycho's opening shot). A late scene in a shadowy basement stands apart from all that preceded it as an incongruous slice of horror melodrama.<br /><br />After a movie as cold and methodical as Zodiac, perhaps it's no surprise that director David Fincher followed it up with something as saccharine and fuzzy as Benjamin Button.",0

"Beautiful, Heart-Wrenching and Elegantly Written Prepare for tears!<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is the book I had been dying to read since Tumblr went crazy about it. The quotes, the metaphors and the constant fan-girling on everyones blog was tempting enough, however at first I just didn't want to give in. HOWEVER...I did. I caved and I am so glad that I did!<br /><br />Hazel Grace is a cancer patient and her life threatening cancer cells have made her see life in a different perspective. She has what some people would call 'morbid views' however, people who can see her torment will understand that her views are nothing more then REAL. However, when she met this boy called Augustus and her weekly cancer-group-therapy, she was overwhelmed and her real feelings got in the way and tried to make her not fall in love. But of course, the story is a love story...but like no other. A cancerous love story where the binding fire between the two is merely their potential death.<br /><br />You will cry and sob within the book. You will feel your heart break.<br /><br />Please don't just 'wait for the movie'. Read the book, read the feelings. You will not regret it. John Green has delivered a beautiful yet horrible story in a very soothing and heart-warming way.",1

As someone mentioned below you can only find blu ray quality conversion in Rocky 1, Rocky 2 out of the 5 Rocky series and I totally agree.Don't count the last recent one. You won't find the quality on Rocky 3,4 and 5. They just upscaled I am afraid.Its a shame really as we all want the best for Rocky on blu ray.

"Underwhelmed Have most of Joes stuff and generally like the guys output. This album however is not living up to his albums of the last few years. There seems to be a predominance of horn and piano across all the tracks, which adds a more traditional feel, but detracts from Joes own styling.<br />Unlike past albums theres no jump out tracks ( Oh Beautiful comes close, is that horns tagged in again at the end?) with mediocrity being established across the whole album. Its not bad but after two full uninterrupted listens on proper speakers my general response is one of disappointment.<br />I dont think this will be hammered on my playlists like the others.",0

It is a case of a sad 'my parents ignored me' childhood- Which personally I think is irrelevant to the business.<br /><br />The book is an ego deomnstration of arrogance.<br /><br />Summer, 20, Student.<br />Recommend: Biz Stone's biography.",0
"Ok follow up but no opus. So Mumford follow up conquering the universe with this collection of songs that really sound like out-takes from the first CD. There are no great stand out songs on this CD for me, no 'Winter Winds' or 'the Cave' or 'Lion Man' etc and the whole thing feels like a slighty rushed attempt to keep their name in the frame before people focus on the next big thing. Not that I blame them for that or anything, despite all the knockers I really liked the first album but this one seems to slide by me without any of the songs really making much of an impact. Still, I doubt it wil stop them going on to even greater recognition, fame, riches and glory and in the right environment I'm sure some of these songs will fill out a great set, however if you were expecting a 'seize the day' moment from this CD you might, like me, just be a little disappointed.",0

"would like to see The quality of the product is divine.<br />All three books come in a red box that has a golden Hogwarts emblem on it, which is exactly what I; as a huge Harry Potter fan, would like to see. Each of the books has history of its contents throughout, which again is what I'd like to see. They are quite thin books but to know that they are each based on one thing amazed me. Even if you never come around to reading them, they are such a prized possession to have sitting on your bookshelf for everyone to see, and at a bargain of a price, too.<br />Go out of our way to buy these because they truly are something of a rarity!",1
"Like so many of my generation (50+) Like so many of my generation (50+), I was really looking forward to this and got it on the day of release. I've listened to it a few times. That means, I've sat and listened to it, not just had it as background. Gilmour's guitar sounds are, as you'd expect perfect, surreal and beautiful all at once. But.....it's just so boring. There is nothing there to bring me back time and again. Sorry chaps, but this sounds like an attempt to boost your pensions and nothing more. Shame you didn't just retire gracefully and live on past successes.",0
Poor picture quality(Blu-ray version) This is one of my favourite war films. So I was very exited when I saw it was to be released on Blu-ray. But after watching it I feel let down . The picture is only slightly better than on DVD. So I would recommend saving your money & wait to see if a remastered version is released.,0

It was delivered to me here in France in good time, but I still haven't listened to it. Reason? One normally expects vinyl albums to play at 33rpm. Not this one - it plays at 45! I have a high end record deck (Linn Sondeck LP12) which only plays at 33rpm. Still the sleeve looks nice in large format!",0

"Don't buy All of the other 1 star reviews of this product pretty much cover it, but I wanted to register my disgust.    This book is packed cover to cover with untenable and offensive claims backed up with a poor grasp of physics and out-of-context quotes from people who no longer have the opportunity to protest at being misquoted.    The one ligitimate point made by the book is hardly original.  The author encourages you to think positively.  People with a positive outlook do tend to take more opportunities and are able to frame their experiences in a better light than those who think negatively.  If you want to learn how to think more positively, there are many practical self-help books out there which offer advice based on verifiable evidence and are written by people qualified in psychology.",0

"Spoilt by the F*** word There are some great songs, real angst, but why wasn't it made clear beforehand that the lyrics were not always for family listening. Best track on the album spoilt by the use of the F*** word, just not needed.",0
"Not bad, could have been better..... Having enjoyed the first book I did sort of enjoy this as well, though I found myself looking for something a little bit more grounded in an erotic reality familiar to me rather than the rarefied atmosphere of the super rich Mr Grey. I enjoyed Lexy Harper's Bedtime Erotica and a couple of others I stumbled into through Amazon's recommendations. However, you have to try [[ASIN:B007A2FNW6 Insatiable (Full Length Novel)]] by Julie O'Neill. Insatiable is absolutely superb!!!!<br /><br />I've put off starting the final book so far. I'm sure I will read it, but perhaps after a break.",0

"Madonna The Complete Studio Albums I really like Madonna.  She was the symbol of what it was like growing up in the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />The first album Madonna I was given for a Christmas present and I thought it was really good.  The other albums - Like A Virgin and True Blue were all really brilliant. Madonna, Like A Virgin and True Blue were all on vinyl LPs.  Later I purchased Ray of Light and Music, both on CDs.  They were very good.<br /><br />I didn't buy Like a Prayer, Erotica, Bedtime Stories, American Life, Confessions on a Dance Floor and Hard Candy.  When I saw Madonna The Complete Studio Albums on Amazon I bought it straightaway.  Having listened to all the albums I can say without a doubt that only the songs which she has released as a single - not albums - are worth bothering with.",0

"Oh dear Its another Mark Knopfler album that basically does what it says on the tin. And there lies the problem as MK hardly breaks sweat on any of the tracks and seems barely awake on most. Nice twee music for dozing off to etc.<br />Songs about being behind with the rent, really?<br />Why not a radically different approach for a new album or perhaps a Hot Chip remix and an injection of some well-needed spice.<br />Yawn",0

"The beginning of the new Metallica This is definitely the album where Metallica started to go downhill.    The vocals have become more poppy than their previous albums,the songs just sound more mellow, the guitar is not as fast and hard to play as the previous albums and the album is just low on the old Metallica energy.      Ofcourse by the way things go this album recieved high levels of praise and tons of rewards and positive reviews, all these factors made this album made Metallica serious money basically making this album a complete sellout.    I practically feel guilty buying a decent, old Metallica album because of the way they are today.    I only gave them two stars because if you wanted to buy one of their worse albums this would be the one to buy as the guitar playing is better than all of the more modern albums by Metallica.    If you want to buy a decent Metallica album then buy one of these:  Kill Em All  Ride The Lightning  Master Of Puppets  And Justice For All",0

"19th & 20th century clothes I repeat the remarks I made for the 2 books above.  All three are excellent.  I only wish I had the money, time and energy to make all the costumes and conduct a mannequin show to show them off.  I am going to a Southern Counties Costume Society AGM on Saturday, 1st March 2014 and I am looking forward to seeing the Eleanor of Teledo dress which I understand will be shown on a live model and a talk given by Sarah Bartlett.  I am wondering if she used a Janet Arnold pattern or created it herself.  I was fascinated with the 1920s dresses in this book.  They must have looked quite stunning in the materials used.  I am wondering if Janet has done anything on the 1960s?",1

Listed Wrong!!! THIS SET IS NOT COMPLETELY REGION FREE (like the title would lead one to believe). ALL OF THE DVDs ARE REGION 2. ALL OF THE BLURAYs  ARE REGION FREE. That aside it is a very nice and well put together box-set and I think I'll probably keep it rather than hassle with returning it. I'll just have to try and find a way to rip .iso images of all the dvds and make them region free and re-burn. However i will miss the disc art. :/,0

Disappointed really not much time in the Wilderness I bought Into The Wild expecting a movie where the Christopher Mercandless is fed up of modern society and embarks on a adventure to Alaska to live in the wilderness. But what I got was a completely different to what I expected the movie is just his struggle making it  there and living as a gypsy. The only two good things about this movie is the start or the first chapter when he's with his parents etc and when he made it to the Alaskan wilderness so for this reason I'm going to rate it a 3.,0

"The Iron Lady The Iron  lady<br />This has to be one of the best  films I have watched  I have a interest in politics and hadn't seen this film up until today .<br />This film stars Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher , and plays the role with great  beauty and compassion  and in a very dignified manner .<br />The film charts Margaret's wish to stand as MP and later her passion to become Prime Minister .But what if anything is the most outstanding and beautiful part of this film ,is her love for her husband Dennis and his love for his wife Margaret. a beautiful romantic bond that they both shared together as well as a really strong couple .<br />i believe that her marriage to Dennis is what gave her the strength and courage to become Prime Minister, and to  stand as one of the most memorable PM'S we have ever witnessed .<br />What I think is so lovely about this film, is that it is filmed with care and consideration , just as Mrs Thatcher would have wanted .",1
A COPY OF THE SHADES OF GREY TRILOGY I would not recommend the trilogy because the story line is basically a copy of the Shades of Grey trilogy (which I would recommend) with a few changes. I am actually surprised that the author Sylvia Day has not been sued for copyrights infringements!,0

"Talented This wasn't for me but was for my girlfriend and she loves this album, she always has it playing in her car, but as they are not really my type of genre, they are talented and the albums isn't actually too bad. They have a few good songs which are catchy and Story of My Life is a really good song. Would recommend if you're into the boy bands.",1
"Woefully misrepresented....... If you are wanting to get into the Beatles and their various facets, I guess this is okay from George's side BUT.....you would be much better served getting All Things Must Pass, which to these ears is the best post-Beatles Beatle album ever made. It is represented here by just two songs. In fact, the whole thing is cobbled together rather shabilly with a ton of Beatles-era tracks that even the most cloth-eared dolt must know. I think its high time that a new George Harrison retrospective was issued, combining his Apple, Dark Horse and Wilbury years. George was the first artiste to put out a triple album (and he did it twice!) so he deserves another one!   This is a typical lp era compilation squeezed into the confines of forty odd minutes, yet it remains the only source of the excellent 'Bangla Desh' on cd, so its a tad frustrating for completists to have to trawl through songs they know by heart on myriad albums and compilations just for this!   Let's update this once and for all. Please. With a few bonus tracks....    Post review comment: This review is a tad out of date now, a new Harrison compilation was released about 18 months later, and although it was not what I was rather hoping for in this review, it spans a couple of discs and is a decent all round collection. No bonus tracks though.....grrrr",0

"Booooorrrrrring Over-rated and oh so boring. Okay, the special effects are good but that's not enough to carry a film with virtually no plot. I kept hoping that Alien was lurking and would leap out to liven things up a bit. Clooney looked like Buzz Lightyear but without the charisma. Just had a look at some of the 5 star reviews to see what is supposed to be so good about this film. The only thing I'd agree with is the quality of the special effects. I didn't find it tense at all. Apollo 13 was tense.   The only redeeming thing about this is it isn't very long, only 80 ish minutes. Still, it's one to avoid.",0

"Le Nozze de Figaro. Berlin/Barenboim 2000 Having recently watched the production of Figaro at The Royal Opera House Covent Garden conducted by Antonio Pappano and directed by David McVicar I am impressed by how superior it was to the one from Berlin.The sets in Berlin were dreary and bore no similarity to what one might have expected to see in the palace of a spanish aristocrat in the eighteenth century. Of what significance can we atttach to the cluter of brooms on the floor in Act One. Likewise the costumes, drab and with no discernable relevance to any historical period. The staging was overloaded with what one could describe as Producers Gimmicks, much jumping on and off chairs and wrestling on the floor and whilst we know that Cherubino was enamoured with the Countess I doubt if we would have seen him sprawling over her. The Producer in fact appearing to have dismissed any attempt to re-create the period in which the Work is set. I had the impression that Barenboim may have had misgivings about what was going on on the stage as his conducting seemed to lack sparkle.  Fine singers, a great orchestra and a distinguished conductor sadly added up to a disappointing result.",0
"Diversiity Lesson! Not really as described, was expecting a sort of Falling Down Film, but got a diversity Lesson instead.    No Blood and Guts here!",0
"A good start to the Harry Hole series. This is the first book of the Harry Hole novels and was first written in its original Norwegian back in 1997. The second novel remains unavailable at present and I trust will appear in the UK soon.<br />It is perhaps rather surprising that a first story of an Oslo policeman should be set entirely in Australia so we have to wait to be introduced to the Oslo team until book 2. Nevertheless it has all the hallmarks of good plot development, twists and story telling that we see in later books although for me this was one of the weaker novels. The characters are well drawn and descriptions of areas of Sydney sound authentic from my brief visits there. However, I have doubts that a great white shark was kept in the Sydney Aquarium at that time - they are notoriously difficult to maintain in captivity.<br />Overall a good read and something that all fans of Harry Hole will want to read.",0

"Best book ever This is the most enjoyable book I have ever read. I picked it up in a shop whilst waiting for a friend, read the first paragraph and didn't put it down again. Beautifully written and like 'Moth smoke' leaves you with something to think about long after you have finished.",1

"TALES OF SORROW AND JOY FOR THE BURGUNDY BOY Oh no John no.....Would you buy this man a drink? Probably. There is a strong sense of lessons learned here, but this is far from the definitive rock memoir described by some reviewers who should know better. Taylor is actually way better writing about his parents, childhood in the Birmingham suburbs  and being a fan than he is about his coke-snorting, bed-hopping heyday with Duran Duran when you could be in bed with a hcik an hour after meeting her at the hotel reception. What lucky ladies&#62; The transformation from the geek checking out a Roxy Music sound-check to the fully-fledged rock aristocrat hanging out with the likes of David Bowie and Bernie Edwards of Chic was alarmingly quick. John (born Nigel) is good on the early days of Duran Duran and it is  lovelyto hear the chaps were good to each other, splitting credits and royalties democratically, although it got a bit nastier later. But was Rio the masterpiece John believes? Did this group define a decade?. Across the West Midlands, at pretty much the same time you had Two-Tone and UB40. For all the hype devoted to Simon Le Bon's lyrics (sixth form poetry that falls short) and the sheer genius of Nick Rhodes (you what?),  the band owed a lot to MTV video rotation and some solid hooks. John ruefully admits that Rio was probably the peak and Seven and the Ragged Tiger was not quite as 'visceral.' But a remixed 'The Reflex', thanks to the guys from Chic, saved the day. Don't look for any insights into Sri Lanka, although it was a cracking location for video shoots, what with all those elephants. It was another Taylor who got the tummy bug there. John owns up (bravely) to a case of crabs, nobly sorted out by former POW Dad. John  loves Sydney and New York, but offers no more than cliches on either. &#34;It was so close to Central Park&#34; etc. He is way much better on the Bullring shopping centre. Inevitably, having flown so high, world at our feet etc, there is a fall and a turn to some kind of 'higher power'.YAWN...... Coca Cola at one point sponsored the group, a little ironic. Amanda de Cadenet appears to have been a bit of a mistake, but not as big a mistake as the Power Station's cover of Get it On.",0

"Fantastic game Been playing this game the last few hours now and I'm not usually one to review a game by any means but this game utterly deserves it. The game is fantastic all round from the beautiful environments, the customizability, the amount of skills and upgrades, the voice acting, the little minor details such as the blood splatters, the plot so far it's also surprisingly interesting. All that I can say is be patient with the download and you won't be disappointed at all. Hopefully although I doubt it will happen, gameloft will bring out its predecessors for the kindle fire HD too. As I would definitely go back to where it all began!",1

"A GOOD REHEARSAL, BUT... Had this been an \\""""official\\"""" bootleg recording, I suppose my expectations would have been in synch with this release... Had I been there that night, it might be fun to have a souvenir of the evening. But this is simply not up to the standards set by both these great musicians. I dig Dixieland Jazz and Clapton is a master in nearly any genre. It's not just the poor sound quality, it feels like a rehearsal. In fact, it feels like the first rehearsal. I would have loved to have heard this collaboration three nights later, with a much better recording. This pales in comparison to the wonderful -- rehearsed -- music Clapton made with Dr. John several years back. Nothing on this recording begins to compare with Clapton and Dr. John's \\""""St. James Infirmiry.\\"""" I recommend you search for that instead.",0
"slightly disappointed I have read this series of books since 1992. I've read the books over and over as each new release has made it to the shelves. I felt horrible when Robert Jordan passed away, and was pleasantly surprised when Brandon Sanderson took over and did such a great job.<br /><br />I was disappointed at how a series that has been a part of my life for over 20 years has been ended, though. I felt that MOL was rushed, of all things, ignoring the plethora of characters that have been introduced over time to focus on battle scenes that are not central to the story. It leaves unanswered questions, and many of the revelations seem contrived.<br /><br />The sense of closure is great, since we finally get to see the ta'veren do what they were born for. Some of the deaths are shocking, some don't seem in keeping with what you'd expect to happen, and some are predictable. There are some great twists and turns and there are some that you've probably been aware of since the mid 90's.<br /><br />I wonder if some of the things that happen in the book were actually approved by RJ, or if they were added because someone felt that they would make a better book. The feel of the story is off somehow. I'll read this novel over and over again like all the other books in the series, and I hope in time that I come to enjoy it more.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. This book is not a legendary end to an epic series, but is an end.",0
This is without a doubt one of the worse Ryan Adams albums if not the worst he has ... This is without a doubt one of the worse Ryan Adams albums if not the worst he has ever made. It sound like a collection of 'demos' - and not very good ones at that! Only 'My wrecking ball'  can match the quality of his songs on 'Ashes and Fires'. Ryan Adams has made a great play of this latest offering as being self-produced - well it shows!! Ryan Adams needs a top producer at the helm of his albums and someone like is Glyn Johns is just the man.,0
"Very disappointing I am afraid this version has been for me very disappointing. I have loved the book for many years and I don't think this film does the book justice at all.  <br /> <br />Fist of all, I think that the main characters in the film are not fit for their roll. In the book Anne is 27 and has lost  the first bloom of youth but still she is described as pretty, of course not as pretty as when she was eighteen and not the kind of prettiness that catch the eye maybe, but certainly not plain and very plain Amanda Root is  in this film. It is not that I think that all main characters must be played by beautiful people. I think that if the characters are  right for them you just can see them like that. Maybe not at the beginning but certainly when you get used to them. In this case, it is just the opposite, the more I see of Amanda, the less I could believe that she was \\""""Anne\\"""". No beauty or prettiness, no countenance, no elegance,  no physical attractiveness at all. More than with sweetness, she rather looks all the time like a frightened mouse and of course I could not believe that any Mr Eliot could stare at her in Lime where \\""""she was suppose\\"""" to have recover her \\""""bloom\\"""". <br /> <br /> Of course you can fall in love with a plain girl, but Anne is not plain, and anyway  that is so, if you can have a more intercourse with her than a few polite words and a few glances which is here the case. The only part of the film where she speaks more than two words with him is when the accident happens in Lime. Here she shows spirits, but It is hard to believe that he could fall in love with her just for this short episode.   <br /> <br />I did not like C.W either. He is described in the book as a man with a great deal of attractiveness but I found him rather coarse, too boasting. Nothing to do with the idea of him I had from the book. <br /> <br />The performance of Miss Eliot, the older sister I found it the worst of them all. She is described as proud and conceited, but here she is  almost all the time over-acted, as if she was all the time out of temper, to a point that I find even  ridiculous. Her relationship with Anne in the book is of absolute  indifference to her sister, but in the film she shows contempt and even I could say true dislike for her, which I cannot  understand at all. <br /> <br />The rest of the characters are quite good in my opinion. Very remarkable the performance of Mary, the other sister.  <br /> <br />Anne's father, I think is very good portrayed in the film. Of course his ridiculous reaction to the public announcement of Anne engagement is not his fault. I couldn't believe my eyes when I sew such impossible situation. C.W. asking, almost shouting Anne's father permission in a crowded room and the absurd reaction of the father wondering in public: \\""""What ever for\\""""... A man with such a family pride it is impossible that could wonder at anyone  desire of becoming part of his family. Such an honour!  I myself wonder why this unnecessary and ridiculous end.  <br />",0

"unless they buy a very poor value for money top-up (which would also be spent ... Somebody somewhere is lining their pockets because of the in-app purchasing within this game. The game is geared around being a money-spinner, leaving a very unsatisfied player with nothing to do after a few minutes of free play every 5 hours, unless they buy a very poor value for money top-up (which would also be spent within minutes). I did purchase a 'starter pack' after my initial interest in the game - and I failed to receive it for some reason. I could not find a simple means of refund anywhere.

When the book comes out, it is already 6 months behind and it doesn't provide models for speaking like another set of Cambridge books do (not this series). I am sick of Cambridge cheating people with this garbage formula and I wasted good money on this. Stop cheating people and write a proper book. It says on the cover - with answers. Their model answers for writing are limited to certain bands. It needs to improve, but hasn't. Do not give this book a good grade unless you want to see them doing the same rubbish for book 10. If you want a book with more tests, consider the Official IELTS test book by Peter May - purple colour. There are more tests in it and more answers. Ciao.",0

"Very disappointed 3 CDs with only 12 tracks on each. Although the first cd included several well-known tracks I was surprised that there were a few of their most popular ones missing.  I couldn't understand why 3 other much less well-known tracks had been included instead!  The second was almost a copy of the first (but live).  I thought that the missing popular tracks would be included in the 2nd, but no.  The 3rd cd seemed to have all sorts of 'workshop snippets', some of which, again, sounded like repeat tracks included in the 1st & 2nd cds.  Sometimes wonder if these compilations are churned out as a bit of a 'money spinner'! Feel a bit cheated! :(",0

"Skyflawed 00Lemon I watched this film on sky so with adverts it was almost 3 hrs long. I turned it off after wasting about 2hrs 40mins of my life on this unmitigated piece of shite. Anyone who gave this film a good review needs psychiatric testing. More holes in the plot than in the ceiling after bond unloads clip after clip of ammo without hitting a thing. I thought he was meant to be the ultimate secret agent. Also, after being shot by a high powered rifle in the train-top fight scene he manages to sink about 100 m in the river. Totally unrealistic given the fact that Daniel Craig's acting leads me to believe that he is entirely made of wood. I thought Brosnan was bad but this twat takes the biscuit. People might say that it's just a fantasy film but in that case why are they trying to copy the infinitely superior Bourne films, sometimes even plagiarising entire scenes (EG. the aforementioned scene). By the way, after shooting bond off of the train, the token black female character seems to forget to shoot the baddie even though there is still plenty of time. Later it is insinuated by bond that she was such a good shot that she deliberately missed his vital organs.Why didn't she aim for his legs then? I could tear this film to pieces if i could be bothered but i don't think it's worth the effort. B.T.W.  I turned the film off after the bit when Dench (head of M.I.5.) emerges from the secret tunnel and keeps a low profile by waving a flashlight about in the dark. You'd think she'd know better but then it just about summed the film up. Absolutely appalling from start to as near the finish as my poor confused mind could bear to get. Roger moors left eyebrow has got more on-screen charisma than the entire cast of this film put together. Even borrowing actors (Finney) from the Bourne films couldn't make a dent in this retarded screenplay. If you like bond films (and i did before this), you'd be better off getting the more believable one starring Rowan Atkinson. P.S. Franchise terminated with extreme prejudice. But not by Bond - Apparently he couldn't hit a cow's arse with a banjo anymore.with extreme prejudice. But not by Bond - Apparently he couldn't hit a cow's arse with a banjo anymore.",0

"A good companion to World War Z I read this book prior to World War Z (after buying the two together) and found it gave me a good insight at what the characters in that book had been told to do prepare themselves for survival in the \\""""Zombie War\\"""", as there are references to it throughout.<br /><br />It seems that Brooks has put a lot of thought into this book, treating it as though he was really writing a manual for a zombie outbreak, as the tactics and survival tips are very descriptive and go into very deep detail and also include diagrams in most cases.<br /><br />As a stand-alone book, 'The Zombie Survival Guide' is probably a bit of a waste of money, but if you treat it as an introduction to World War Z, it is a pretty decent (and novel) read.",0

US IMPORT!! I also bought this product and was disappointed to find the DVD did not play as it is a US import. This should have been stated somewhere and ending up making a useless christmas present.,0
"Would have been a four... but... I would have rated this movie as a four had it not been a flip DVD! I have to agree with most the reviewers that crticized this product for being a \\""""flippie\\""""!! No one likes the movie stopping half way through and needing to flip the DVD... even the transition isn't that smooth! It's more like a chop!    As far as the movie goes, it's one of the great gangster movies... and like all good gangster movies they are long and full of details that you have to notice in order to appreciate the movie.Having to flip the DVD over after it suddenly stops doesn't really help you following the plot as closely as you could!    This being a Martin Scorsese film in addition to Casino... I have to say that he copied quite a lot from this movie into Casino.. like for example Joe Peci's character and the way he ends... almost identical.    A good gangster movie but I wish it wasn't on a flip DVD!! Maybe if a full length version is released then I would say, go for it absolutely!",0

"This book is not a pearl... We received this book as a gift at the birth of our son from a friend. The story starts well with what seems to be a loving mother cuddling and professing her eternal love for her unresponsive child, but becomes more and more maudlin as the story progresses until the death (yes: DEATH) of the mother is imminent and the child is made aware of his own transience and at last reciprocates, and in turn goes home to love his own child with more awareness.<br />In my opinion these are themes far too heavy to inflict upon a child's psyche.<br />What seems at first to be just a humorous way of exaggeratingly depicting the mother's love on a first read through becomes disturbing by the second read. The mother undoubtedly loves her child but never tells him when he is awake, but only when he is fast asleep - going to quite ridiculous lengths to do so (climbing at night through his window with the aid of a ladder etc. to hoist the great big lummox of a man with superhuman strength out of his good warm bed on to her lap to rock and sing to him ...Hmmmm.)<br />In a way, the point one presumes the author is trying to make, - hence I suppose all the rave reviews - is that a mother's unabated love is eternal and unrelenting, and that she will always view her child as her `baby' no-matter how old that child may be.<br />Further, I will give the author the benefit of  the doubt that  maybe the reason he made his Mother only sing her love song to the son at night when he was unaware, was to show her wish not to make him feel indebted to her in anyway - as an expression of unconditional love.<br />The question is: Is this healthy? I think not. Children need good examples of how to give love and receive it ... and preferably before we their parents are at deaths door.<br />My husband who loved his own mother dearly and lost her early was reduced to tears by this book and absolutely hates it.<br />I don't hate it. However, I do try to live my life's moments to the full by telling those around me how I feel about them now while I can - life is too unpredictable to do otherwise, and I get a thrill out of watching my son at four years doing the same. When he wraps his little chubby arms around people he likes and says `you're nice, thank you!' or `you're my friend' or `I like you so much' - I feel he is adding little pearls to the silken string of his life that will add up to an inalienable treasure of his own making.<br />This book is no pearl and I am sure I will never read it to him.",0

"Decent introduction but not good for learning to program. This book will not teach you how to program. However, given this, if you already know the main principles behind programming, it is too slow. Really, one should understand the fundamentals of computer science (orders of growth, iterative and recursive processes, state, core data structures, evaluation) before learning this (maybe through something like SICP which teachs the fundamentals of programming rather than the language).Once you know this, all you need to do to learn Haskell is to learn it's basic syntax for and what makes Haskell especially different to other languages (namely Monads and purity and lazy evaluation, typeclasses and ADT). However, this book takes too long explaining concepts one should already understand (such as recursion). .",0

"It's Perfume but not as we know it Jim.... This should have a been a great movie. The book by Patrick Suskind was stunning and clever but somewhere along the way the movie lost the plot if not the smell!!  I know it's strange to make movie about smell but Suskind made it work in his book so why not the movie. The cast list is excellent - Hoffman, Rickman, Whitshaw and many others, the plot compelling, the period fascinating and the concept beguiling so what could go wrong. Somewhere in this film is a great movie trying to get out but the problem is that the direction is weak, the cast are camp ( Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of the Italian perfurmier is a low point) and scenes that worked magically in the book look embarassing here - wait till you see the scene where Grenouille is about to executed and his perfume literally saves the day but not the movie.    I really wanted to like this film with its intriguing plot and poking fun at human folly but it disappoints on many levels. Poor direction, weak acting, improbable scenarios and a lack of real conviction - it is like all of the fragrance has been drained from the movie and we are left with stale water - colourless, odourless and neutral",0

"The books and the box they come in themselves were all perfect. The box feels nice to the touch and ... Arrived the next working day after ordering it, neatly placed in the Amazon box and protected with scrunched up paper.<br /><br />The books and box were wrapped tight in cellophane for added protection. The books and the box they come in themselves were all perfect. The box feels nice to the touch and is decorated amazingly and the covers of the children's addition are different to what I'm used to in the Harry Potter books, but in my opinion, look so much nicer. The covers have a textured feel to them which add to a sense of quality. The pages also feel high quality. The font is naturally easier to read than on the adult versions of the book.<br /><br />I love these books because they pull you from whatever reality you're living and thrust you headlong into the magical world at Hogwarts, a place everyone wanted to be when we were younger and still want to be now. The way the books are written makes me feel that when characters win points for their House, I'm there winning points with them, and books don't usually have that effect on me.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend these books to all. If you don't get completely sucked in my the story like me, they're still a fun read.",1

"Good fun This was a good book.  The anecdotes would've fitted nicely into most other tales of rock `n' roll excess, like Slash (G n' R), The Dirt (Motley Crue) and Walk This Way (Aerosmith).  This, however, is a drawback.  You get the feeling you've read it all before.  That's no fault of Dave's - he's just recounting his days of sex, drugs and rock `n' roll with Megadeth and they happen to be very similar tales to those already told by the aforementioned bands.<br /><br />I'm no Megadeth fan; I could've counted the number of songs I knew of theirs on one hand before reading this book.  I just knew of Dave's reputation as a bit of a nutcase and thought it'd make for an entertaining read, and that's exactly what it was.  Mustaine comes across as a decent enough guy but with all the characteristics of most other heavy metal front men - arrogant, opinionated, aggressive, rude, reckless, immature.<br /><br />I assume he's reasonably talented too...in his field of music.  But, my God, having since ploughed through bits of Megadeth's output over the years I am of the realisation that the music's bad.  Really bad.  Megadeth?  Megacrap more like.  I generally think metal's pretty awful anyway.  I just find the scene pretty fascinating, especially the boom back in the 80's.<br /><br />On the whole though, it was a good read.  I imagine this is essential reading for fans of the band.  For someone like me, who thinks heavy metal's a load of old sh!te, but is fascinated by music in general, it's nothing more than a good yarn about some ginger topped hell raiser.",0

"Jack Reacher 19 I dislike thrillers written in the first person and my heart sank when I read the first line of this book. As far as I can remember, only one of the previous 18 Reacher novels has been in this format and it doesn't really work for me. That wasn't the main problem however. Having started off well, the second half became quite tedious as a result of too much conversation and very little action until near the end. Disappointing I'm afraid!",0

"Film good. Dvd bad Film itself is good, im a fan of the fast and furious movies. Only one missing from personal dvd collection was tokyo drift although had seen it before. Purchased this to complete collection, i  watched this dvd immediately after arrival to my disappointment the dvd jumps and doesnt play smoothly especially the first half of the movie. Cleaned with duster and watched again couple days later and is exactly the same. Which is very frustrating. The cost of the dvd it is not worth the hassel or cost of returning/exchanging.",0

"Joe Elliot's Voice is Totally Shot to Pieces Just thought i would give this album a listen to as i think Def Leppard are a great Band and i have never felt more disappointed than hearing this Live Album.<br />The Guitar Work and Percussion is absolutely top notch and sounds like the originals with Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell as well as Rick Savage and Rick Allen on the top of there game on nearly every track.<br />The Problem here like many other live albums is that the main vocalist eg:Joe Elliot's voice is now totally shot and it deflates nearly every song and makes them all sound second rate.<br />Songs from the Sparkle Lounge was a fantastic album and a return to form and then we have the Mirrorball Live Album and now this which shows Joe Elliots voice in a true light as totally shot which is a tragedy.<br />Drums, Bass and Lead Guitar can never age but voices unfortunately can and it definitely exposes it here on this album no matter how well they package it.<br />For Me Pyromania,Hysteria and Songs from the Sparkle Lounge will be the crowning glory of Def Leppard but this is definitely not a great live album.",0

"I love the film, but avoid buying this version. The abyss is a great film and I would happily give it five stars. Unfortunately, the reason I have given it two stars is because of the production value of the DVD itself.<br /><br />I only bought the DVD version because as of when I bought it, the film wasn't available to buy on bluray.  When I loaded the disc into my bluray player, the resolution of the film was so small that it barely filled a quarter of the size of my 32\\"""" TV.  Even with the zoom functions engaged on both my player and the TV, I still couldn't make it bigger, and the quality of the image rapidly degraded.  By playing the disc in my Xbox360 I managed to get the image a little larger, but still the quality was terrible, and made the film almost unwatchable.<br /><br />There was an unexpected bonus though, as this single disc edition contains both the theatrical release and the directors cut of the movie which I was not expecting.<br /><br />Conclusion: A great film, spoilt by terrible mastering to DVD. Wait for a re-release or remastered bluray.",0
"Khaled Husseini Was a little disappointed with this , I had such great expectations after reading Kite runner and A Thousand Splendid suns which I absolutely loved so I have been waiting for some time for this and I am sorry to say it did not live up to the first 2, still a reasonably good read may be my expectation were too high after the first 2",0

"Hunting time Again! aaaaaa....predators. one of my favourite iconic movie creatures.<br /><br />This movie totally ignores the sheer and utter rubbish of AVP requiem as it makes a bold attempt to recreat the first predators movie we all know and love.<br />The movie is ok but PERSONALLY I think Adrian Broody (though bulked up and fit) doesnt have the complete action presence for the role.<br />Anther thing is that there was no memorable fight sequence.To be honest, i found the fight scene between a predator and the Yakuza dude really funny!They tried so hard with the action but it doesnt stick to your memory.<br /><br />To sum it up, this movie will keep you entertained while its on play but the moment it ends,its over! no replay value.<br /><br />Lets hope the next installment does a better job.",0

"Beware of Hiden meanings in the lyrics Rihanna has an individual voice and when her Caribbean accent shines through on tracks such as 'Cockiness' I enjoy it. I like 'Farewell', it's a kind of power ballad, not unique but addictive after a few listens.

"Beautiful disaster. After reading so many good reviews I couldnt wait to read this book but unfortunately I was a bit dissapointed. I liked the characters in the beginning of the book but I found Travis to get on my nerves a lot as I got further into the story, if the slightest little thing happened to Abby he would come charging to the rescue over silly little things, he was too over protective and controlling. Abby seemed happy to let this happen and seemed to enjoy it really and it was obvious from the beginning what she wanted. The public affection was a bit much for me but that is just the way I am, I just couldnt imagine being as open in public as they were but I suppose the whole point is because of the way they felt and their relationship. They cant live with each other but cant live without neither. I was more annoyed at the ending as though it was perfect when really it was rushed and silly.<br />As much as I havent had alot of positive things to say on this book, I read it all the way through and wanted to know what happened. It is the kind of book that made me want to read it to the end, I wouldnt say I was disturbed after reading it but it did make me feel uneasy a little. I give it a 3 stars as it was ok but wouldnt be too bothered about reading any more on Travis and Abby.",0

"GOODBYE Quo! Having been a quo fan from the early 70's, I was looking forward to seeing this much hyped film, but I have to admit, on seeing it, I was somewhat disappointed. Apart from the much anticipated reunion of the original members, there was little in this documentary that your average quo fan would not have already heard or seen before, some of it many times over. In fact, I was left with a rather empty feeling, as I actually ended up liking the band less by the end. They seemed to revel in talking more about the more trite aspects of their career more than anything else and what's more, they came across as drink/drug obsessed, ignorant, royalists, who are friends with right-wing comedians and Christian fundamentalist singers.  What happened to rock n rollers being anti-establishment?<br /><br />The reunion was nice to see, but sad to see that all the energy that made the original Quo what it was, had all but disappeared, as they laboured their way through the mid-paced `In My Chair'.  I thought there would be more of this much talked about reunion, but no, just one track and that was it - roll the credits. What an anti-climax!<br /><br />It was good to hear from Lancaster and Coughlan after all these years, but Rossi's incoherent cockney ramblings were just tiresome (The fact that Rossi considers the 1976 Live album one of Quo's worst and `In Search of the 4th Chord' one of their best, shows how truly out of synch he is with the band's hard-core fans).<br /><br />I am amazed that this `film' was directed by such a well respected director as Alan Parker, as it had virtually no creativity and was so badly edited it defied belief. Yes, many Quo fans will buy it and like it and that's fine, but the Quo magic has definitely faded considerably for me after seeing this. So, I think it's GOODBYE Quo, rather than Hello Quo!",0

Wow! I was lucky enough to have caught this film at the cinema knowing nothing about it apart from seeing a tantalizing trailer on T.V.  Undoubtedly all films are better seen on the big screen but Cloud Atlas on DVD (and a 26 inch screen) provides a treat for the eye and 6 stories for the price of 1. I don't understand why this film flopped at the box office. A future &#34;cult classic&#34; a la Blade Runner.,1

"Yes tread the boards in a traditional theatre Really purchased because I was there on the night.<br />Yes live nowadays are still technically brilliant - Steve Howe gets better with age in my opinion - but most numbers are played at a sedate pace and Alan White's dynamic, driving drumming has diminished in intensity.<br />Jon Davison's soaring high-register voice enhances old material, but sadly, Geoff Downes is reduced to a supporting role. He covers all the required material but limits solo work confiniing himself to only one extended, rarther repetitive, piano solo on 'A Venture'<br />The big man (Chris Squire) still shows how the bass can be more than part of the rhythm section. Let's hope that the stiffness and mobility issues that seem to have increasingly reduced his stage presence never reach his fingers!<br />Nice to hear a couple of rarely-heard tracks - although only two of the three 'classic' albums are included in this live album.<br />My only gripe is the faded-in applause (perhaps derived from other parts of the concert) that has been grafted in to create an artificial 'atmosphere' on occasions. British Yes audiences tend to be reflective and focused and don't whoop, whistle and holler all the way through like American crowds (ruining many a fine live album in my opinion). It's a shame that someone felt that there wasn't enough background noise and added this here and there in the mix.<br />A memorable evening, however, with the cosy and quaint Hippodrome environment adding to the warmth and intimacy.",0

"Neither Pride and Prejudice nor a good who dunnit I was really looking forward to reading this as I'm a huge P&P fan and had never read a P.D. James. It was nice to immerse myself in the shades of Pemberley again but I soon realised that the characters were just a shadow of their former selves. Elizabeth had lost all of her wit and feistyness, Darcy didn't brood or exude authority. I thought that the red herrings were way too obvious and the actual culpret wholly unlikely, seeming to have been selected simply to make sure it all tied up neatly in the last few pages of the book. I really wanted to enjoy it...but I'm sorry to say I didn't.",0
"Same flaws as the Blaze era Maiden albums... It goes without saying, that as the founding member, bassist and principle song-writer of Iron Maiden, Steve Harris is a genuine giant of rock and metal music.  It also goes without saying that in Maiden's 30+ years of recording, some of their albums have been better that others.    Most would consider The X-Factor (1995) and Virtual XI (1998) to be weak points in Maiden's history.  Both these albums shared some common features.  In addition to being Maiden's weakest albums in terms of chart success, there were also the only two albums where Harris was the lead producer and both these albums featured Blaze Bayley on vocals.  Now, one should not benchmark this 'British Lion' album against Maiden's output as it is a different creative force for Harris, but it is interesting that the flaws of the Blaze album, seem to be apparent with this British Lion album.    Like, the Blaze era Maiden albums, the biggest issue is not the songs.  Rather, it is a weak vocalist who struggles on much of the material and, just as bad, terrible production that lacks dynamics.  It's a real shame, because amongst the 10 tracks on offer, there are some very respectable songs here that are fine examples of hard classic rock delivered with a modern edge.  The closing track, 'The Lesson', also shows Harris pursuing a musical direction that will take many by surprise and wonder why he will not allow Maiden to be a bit more expansive on their own albums?    A great bassist, admirable band leader, fine song writer but, it would seem, Harris isn't cut out for 'production'.",0

It's really jumpy and leaps back and forward through the years with lots of different characters that all seem to have their own stories. They do all join together although I didn't see the need for some of them and I skipped through a few pages.<br />I think the actual storyline was good, a brother a sister separated as young children when they had a very close bond, and finally meeting at the end of their lives, but it could have been so much better.",0
Hugely disappointed Although many of the reviews are 1 and 5 star this really should have basically no stars at all. I watched this film when it came out at the cinema and really looked forward to a thriller with a few jumpy bits/hanging on to your seat bits and maybe a bit of action however the film is absoulute garbage. There is no real story-line and the 1 that is is just ridiculous there is no real point to the film however you cant take your eyes off it but that is because you are trying to make sense of it all - and what you can its just stupid. Films are always better at the Cinema I think but this has to be by far 1 of the worst ive seen and judging by how many were in the cinema me and my ex-girlfriend and 2 other people im sure people had seen some other reviews and made a better choice! Also dont let the cover fool you and the review on the front its a complete waste of your time.,0
"fun and easy read The Undomestic Goddess has the same spark all Kinsella books have. It was witty, fast moving and had loveable characters. It was a very enjoyable read but somehow too far fetched.

"Great Film, Bad, Lazy Transfer This import Studio Canal is no better than an upscaled DVD. Detail is lost, or non-existent. I had hopes for this transfer since Criterion lost the rights to remaster and this appears, no, shows, that the DVD master was transfered directly to Bluray.     Don't waste your money if you have the DVD. Criterion is one of the few who values quality. Hopefully, Criterion will have rights to remaster this great work properly. The film's opening credits are fuzzy yet the English subtitles are sharp. I believe Studio Canal used the original DVD master and only upgraded the subtitles for this release. I suspected that this would be the situation when I haven't seen any feedback about this release. I will think twice before I pre-order again.     Criterion's excellent release of \\""""In The Realm of the Senses\\"""" makes this Studio Canal transfer look worse than Gladiator. I truly regret paying so much for an import that isn't a true highdef product. This total disregard for quality is what makes the average person think that paying extra for high def when this is the result is foolish, and they are correct when this is an example of what is being released.

This album is very dark and a lot more sexual than her usual music, and only includes one hit 'Rude Boy'.<br /><br />I am still a very big fan of Rihanna, but this is not my favourite album of hers. Listen on YouTube before purchasing.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.",1

"CD was faulty Whenever I put this CD onto my iTunes, all of the songs where distorted, like there was some other kind of noise playing whilst the songs were playing and they weren't clear at all. The other 2 CD's that I purchased were fine, but this one, possibly the supposed best of the 3 I bought, doesn't work on my computer, and I get the same strange distorted sound whenever I put these songs onto my iPod.",0

"A Most Wanted Man isn't Our Man in Havana but who was expecting that? In John Le Carre's new novel he explores the nature of the secret war on terror as regards to the surveillance and legal status of suspected terrorists. The novel is, predictably,  written brilliantly and readers will fly through the pages with a flowing enthusiasm. It is a fine way to spend a day or so, this novel will keep you excited and on edge until its truly extraordinary ending, make no mistake this is a first class novel.<br /><br />When le Carre tackles a subject he does it with sensitivity and realistically in a way that you do not find in the Fleming/Buchannan tradition of spy novels. He rather sets his own genre, a sort of accessible Graham Greene, that is perfectly balanced. This snobbery over le Carre's literary credentials is quite enough already - he is a strong and sensitive writer that conveys information in a succinct and compact style that is tantamount to good storytelling. This is what made him one of the voices of a generation and the reason that I hope he will challenge this subject again.<br /><br />In the end what we get from this book is an exploration of the moral ambiguity that underlines the secret war on terror and its links to the pre-war on terror era. It also tries to understand the (relatively)  ordinary people that are caught up in the events over a few days. Le Carre's attempt at writing a lead female character somehow came off well which is frankly a surprise. Le Carre's view of the gung-ho attitude of the CIA is put forward but not preached.<br />In short this is a good book and a great way to spend a day, or a few evenings reading.",0

"Disappointed! I was looking forward to hearing this album by Beyonce and have to say I was not very impressed for the calibre of artist she is the songs were too much of the same boppy, disco beat for me and the lyrics were not very clever.

"Poor language, monotonous and boring.. I read quite a lot, but very rarely go and buy a 'bestseller' or a book that everyone is reading- I quite like to find hidden Gems. I bought this book based on the reviews here but the book is so terrible I can't bear to finish it.<br /><br />Terrible use of language, very dull and almost like a ' draft' or magazine-type story.<br /><br />Each to their own on types of books and taste etc but I personally found it embarassingly poor! A lot of the 'plot' doesn't make sense, found myself skipping paragraphs just to try to get to an 'interesting' part of the book. Very bizarre writing style.<br /><br />Waste of money for me I'm afraid.",0
"Mutilated! This release is deeply disappointing. To cut off almost 30% of the frame to become widescreen is ridiculous. The original full frame looks so much better. Yes Disney may have offered many of their mid-period cartoons in a widescreen cut for cinemas that felt they had to show it that way and for those that never saw the original full frame they would never know what they missed but only a few minutes of an AB test shows what a terrible mutilation this release is. Shame on you Disney, give us the full film! If you can find the 4:3 DVD get it, it is just so much better.",0
TOTAL WASTE Do not bother waste of money,0
good calculator I believe this is probably one of the best calculators in the appstore but i do believe its missing some vital things:<br />You cannot sqaure or cube<br />There is no tan sin or cos button and this would be qreatly appreciated.<br />I like how you can change the colours of background but i would need more of a friendly HCI for me to keep it around but other than that it is surprisingly good.,0

Michael Sheen as Brian Clough in the Damned United, another remarkable piece of casting. For the part of Diana, the casting Director picked someone about 6 inches the wrong size, and it looks like the only preparation was an hour in the hairdressers.",0
"best marvel film so far I never knew much about GOTG characters, but I was very surprised in this film.

Blood Cells\\"""", \\""""Elephant\\""""  & \\""""Get Behind me Satan\\"""").<br />But it seems that as a songwriter, White has simple ran out of ideas.  I'm not saying that this is a bad record (if it was his first, I would call it a promising debut), but it's not, & you have to compare the album to his previous offers. I feel it just fall a little short.Perhaps if White recorded his music in a more experimental manner, it might bear riper fruit.",0

"Boring and not even Funny! Went into this film with high hopes after it has won awards and has a fantastic cast. But I could never have been so disappointed. The storyline is slow, boring and goes nowhere. This is suppose to be a Rom Com and there was hardly any Comedy in it expect for the ending. This film is poorly made and does not deliver the standards which 'Friends with Benefits' set as that film was funny, romantic and sad but this film is just boring!<br /><br />I would recommended you don't pay to see this film and wait for it to come on TV again!",0

A Good Follow Up You can't help but like these guys.. Like previous review by JJ Burton The Whipoorwill was my fav cd last year and was always ( in my opinion ) going to take some beating. But as in previous review there's definetly some good stuff here yes some comes across a bit tongue in cheek but who cares . Read JJ Burton's review as a lot of mine would mirror his views a tip if you like this gender of music but a little bit meater have a listen to Cadillac 3 ..Hope they,1
addictive and fun I was really enjoying this and couldn't stop playing until I got to level 106. I have passed it 4 times but it won't register and just freezes so only getting 3 stars for that reason.,0
Three Stars Does the job its supposed to do and is good value.,0
"Very Humean The dead give away to this book's cynicism is the author's infatuation with David Hume. Unlike Hume, the author doesn't take the time to carefully construct a cogent explanation of reality. He uses Hume without explaining Hume. He excoriates Plato with fully explaining Plato. Instead of entering into that great conversation about reality, we only get to experience the reality of the authors intellect, a painfully arrogant one. It's a puff piece by a a puffed up skeptic who's huffing and puffing about better men's ideas. Skip this one.",0
terrible. I scrapped it terrible.  I scrapped it!,0

"It's good, but oh so predictable. I watched this multi-lingular film in the hopes that it would be as good as the oscars have been showing us. Just like most oscar nominations by now, Babel wasn't spectacular. I can realise why the oscars wanted to nomanite this film into so many categories, but it wasn't because Babel was a good film. The problem with Babel is... well, it's incredibly predictable. The fact that cate blanchett survives at the end? Couldn't they have made it much more dramatic and have her die? Or the fact that deaf girl in Japan doesn't kill herself. It would have been a much better film if it wouldn't have had such a happy ending. Ok, I've said enough about what's wrong with it, i still haven't said what's good about it.<br /><br />Any actor or actress apart from Brad Pitt, are played brilliantly. If you're dissapointed that I said Brad Pitt doesn't act well in this movie, go and watch a film where he does act well, like se7en. But the supporting cast, including the two morrocan boys are some of the best acting i've seen this year, except maybe for the girl who plays ofelia in Pan's Labyrinth. Another good point in Babel is that every character sort of intervines with eachother by the end of the film. Oh, and before I finish the review, may I also note that there is some uncomfortable nudity and sexuality shown in the film. It was a shame I chose this film to watch with my grandmother.",0
awesome Its is a really good game wpuld recomend it to any age. well worth getting.Also cannot believe it is free.,1
"A flimsy petticoat of a whodunit swathed in borrowed finery I came to the novel as a lover of the works of Jane Austen and a newcomer to the work of PD James, lured by the effusions of critics on the back cover that this was an  `assured', `dazzling' and `elegantly gauged'  homage to Austen's work as well as a crackingly good crime novel.<br />I am afraid that it disappointed on every level.<br />As a crime novel, I found it lacking in most of the essentials. Firstly, without giving anything of the plot away, I had no sympathy at all for the victim; the writer utterly failed to establish any of that compassionate connection which is essential if the reader is going to be sufficiently outraged by the crime to be engaged in its solution. He remained a faceless cypher, without substance or humanity.<br />Secondly, I could find no shred of assurance that the accused was not eminently capable of the crime; I didn't care if he swung or not. Characters' repeated protestations of his innocence carried no weight with me and became self-defeating. A second plausible perpetrator would have created doubt and confusion but it isn't until the last possible moment that a back-up is whisked like a magic rabbit from an all-but invisible hat.<br />The clues were there, of course, but so over-shadowed by the hallowed shades of Pemberley and its august occupants that the reader is denied the sporting chance of solving the mystery: another important ingredient in good crime fiction. Characters are allowed to fudge over important details, and keep their `honourable' secrets. Speech is often reported instead of direct. What would (what should) have cut through these blandishments is a crime-solver - a professional or an enthusiastic amateur - but such a figure is woefully lacking. The reader - like the characters - feels himself thrashing uselessly through impenetrable undergrowth without perspective or direction for most of the time. This is the third big failing of this book as a crime novel. But a decent detective would have cut through the wafer-thin prevarications of the witnesses at a stroke, and so of necessity had to be excluded.<br />So I didn't care about the victim, I didn't trust the (purportedly innocent) accused and I felt toyed with by the writer which is perhaps the biggest imposition of all.<br />But these disappointments are nothing compared to the writer's failure to take full advantage of the opportunity she has given herself in setting her novel at Pemberley, in resurrecting the Darcys and the Bennets and of developing their characters and relationships.<br />The characters, I am afraid, are mere chimeras of Austen's creations; Lizzie has no wit, Darcy neither the authority we expect nor the easy confidence or even dry humour we hoped Lizzie's love would uncover. The nature of their married relationship is not explored at all. Jane parrots platitudes like a wind-up toy version of her original, Lydia promises some characteristic displays of vulgarity and excess but is kept largely out of the reader's view. The singularly golden opportunity of writing a scene between Darcy and Wickham, with all the potent sub-text of their boyhood, Georgiana's threatened seduction and elopement, and the fraught period between Lydia's discovery in London and her marriage, is absolutely thrown away, reported in a couple of paragraphs.<br />James' language, after an initial effort, is a lack-lustre attempt to emulate Austen's sublime erudition. The closest she comes is a very pale reflection and at times she seems to give up the attempt entirely: I cannot conceive of Jane Austen ever employing the word `dollop'. I am afraid that lifting phrases directly from the original is disingenuous; they stand like monoliths on the barren plain of the novel's narrative style, which is for the most-part prosaic.<br />The attempt in the prologue, to pr&eacute;cis the plot of Pride and Prejudice, is self-indulgent and unnecessary, likewise the epilogue which attempts to unravel Darcy's thoughts and actions in the earlier novel. Neither is relevant to this novel.<br />All in all a flimsy petticoat of a whodunit swathed in borrowed finery.  James never spoke a truer word than in her author's note: `had [Jane Austen] wished to dwell on such odious subjects, she would have written this story herself, and done it better.'either is relevant to this novel.<br />All in all a flimsy petticoat of a whodunit swathed in borrowed finery.

"Pretty pointless. I bought this after reading on-line about the fast diet. This book does not have anything particularly interesting or useful to contribute to what you can read on the internet. There is a bit of insight into why the fasting works, then a load of pages listing calories of foods and some meal plans. The last chunk is testimonials - I didn't even bother reading it.<br />I had limited success with this diet.  The main problem for me was significant constipation - badly enough to need laxatives from my GP. Only after investigation on-line did I find out that this a known and widespread problem with this diet.",0
Very good This is a great game for all fans of PvP. I would heavily recommend this game to all people who like action games.,1
"Honestly it's just dumb torture porn... Wanted to love it, like I love the original, but it's not even worthy of being compared to it, it's just another &#34;Cabin in the woods&#34; film, no scares, just one scene more brutal than the next, if that's your thing go for it, if you want something that's going to have you hiding behind a pillow, this isn't it.<br /><br />I suppose my biggest gripe with the film is the total lack of humour and the dull cannon fodder characters (excluding Mia) she's actually pretty fantastic. Aside from her character the film really is just a dumb gore fest.<br /><br />Thumbs up for the use of practical effects, some of the best I've ever seen, which is good because the few times they use CG, it looks awful. I also have to say its beautiful film to look at, in a morbid way. Alvarez definitely knows how to direct.<br /><br />If you really want to see it, I'd just go for a rent, I regret buying it, simply because won't be watching it again.",0
Three Stars Good film poor picture very grainy !,0
Ideal as entertainment on a sleep over in Auntie Meira's house Great. Now I know the song as well lol,1
Better than I thought it would be Not brilliant but better than I thought it would be. Had trouble not thinking of Hansel as Hawkeye as he plays this character in the Thor films! Funniest bit has to be that Hansel has diabetes because the witch who caught them in the gingerbread house forced him to eat so much sweet stuff!,0
"OMG! (may be some mild spoilers) I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the book; however some parts seemed very pointless. Then end for instance was unneeded as nothing happened.  The thing that annoys me now I've stopped laughing about it is... recently me and some friends went on holiday taking the previous three books with us. Me and one of my friends sat around and joked about what could happen in this book. We went from Edward's fertility (which is questionable due to his body temperature... but its fiction) to Jacobs imprinting. Guess what? We pretty much got it right; we were trying to find the least likely storyline, not the most possible.    Now that aside I enjoyed the book however I am not very keen on the whole fairytale likeness of the story. I was waiting and waiting for an action packed ending but that failed to come.     Also the one thing that had me screaming at the book was Edward's obsession with the word `love'. A sentence where he can't fit the word in is an unfinished one in his eyes. I found myself for once begging that Edward to shut up!  It started in Eclipse and I tried to ignore it but during the last few hundred pages of this book Edward seems to become obsessed with this word.  I think, sadly, I have fallen out of love with Edward Cullen. He has changed significantly in the end of this book as he did in Eclipse and is just not the same character I fell for in Twilight.   Infact a character I found myself liking was Jacob, and I have been a strong anti-Jacob fan. But having read his book I felt he was the only one that I could get along with, and then I was pleading with Stephenie Meyer in my head that she would have written Jacob's and Leah's imprinting into the book, but I hoped with no avail. Jacob is the only realistic and believable character who is willing to sacrifice himself, but unlike Bella not everyone around him. I do regret my wishing that he ran away and stayed away, perhaps that wish would have been better suited for other characters.Now I know I said \\""""that aside I enjoyed the book\\"""" and it's true I did, some parts are very enjoyable, but equally some parts are down right frustrating, such as Bella's sex craze. That got heavily irritating.   Some of my friends have enjoyed the book thoroughly and to give it a fair chance here are a few of the things they've said...  \\""""Amazing!\\""""  \\""""Good so far\\""""  \\""""Really good, I really liked it, I don't know which one I like best\\""""  I believe it depends on the reader. I would read the book again but not in a hurry, not the way I read Twilight staying up until 4AM.     All in all my view of the book is enjoyable and infuriating at the same time.  The only sure way to know if its for you is to read, but something I would point out is compare the reviews and ratings of this final piece of the saga with the previews books.   x x x x x x x",0

"Just no I have got to say that I did love the first album by Mr Radke \\""""The Drug In Me Is You\\"""" after deciding the give it a shot (I was never his biggest fan and always preferred Craig more when it comes to ETF). That album was a step in the right direction from defining himself away from what Escape The Fate is now.<br /><br />But after listening to this mix of auto-tuned and rap waste, my expectations of the man have once again dropped. Now I am not against bands experimenting with their music and a change can always be refreshing but there is a level which every band should follow for their fans.<br /><br />If Ronnie wants to produce music like what is displayed on this album then that's fine, but he should never of done it under the Falling In Reverse name. Maybe a side project would of been a better option so the employee's of our respected retailers could throw that crap in with the rap and pop section instead of having to display this rubbish in Metal section.<br /><br />So my final verdict, just don't buy this.",0

"Good collection, bad set On the face of it this seems like a good set. It's main selling point being that it contains the remastered Big Generator album, with bonus tracks which has not been available outside of Japan before (unless you pay an extortionate amount for a Japanese import).<br /><br />The CDs are very poorly packaged and the box isn't that nice either. They claim to be &#34;mini-LP&#34; but they're not really. The CDs which are supposed to replicate the wallet-style LPs are housed inside a single-wallet, which is ok... except that the hole for the CD is so big you could fit the CD in it about 5 or 6 times. The CDs are not protected in any way (usually these sorts of sets put the CDs in polythene covers) and are left to rattle around. When I ordered my set (not from Amazon) the copy of Tormato was so badly scratched I had to return the set.<br /><br />As well as poor pachaging the albums do not come with the booklets that are present in the already available Rhino re-issues which also contain the bonus tracks included in this set.<br /><br />Another thing is that this set has been released while Yes are re-issuing albums containing 5.1 mixes and other extras (Close to the Edge came out in this format in October and The Yes Album is coming in April) which would make better additions to a box set collection.<br /><br />This is a badly packaged, poorly designed, rushed, money-spinner of a set. Buy the Rhino re-issues which contain the same music and bonus tracks and much more nicely packaged than this rubbish. Better still buy the CD/Blu-ray or CD/DVD re-issues which are in progress at the moment.",0

I am in no way telling people not to buy this game but for those of you who like the pc version it's like a kick in the teeth not being to be able to progress further, you really defeat the wall and then that's it, nothing else for you to do except mine and build.",0

"very very dull how on earth did this get so many 5 stars reviews - the world has gone mad.     fair enough they may be ok compared to some of the other popular bands out there - but this offers little that hasnt been done before - and there is nothing wrong with copying  a style here or there but if you it has to be done with an engaging delivery and some panache - however this doesnt.    its like a bad mix of the smiths and latter day radiohead with coldplay esque pretentions.    before you go reading all these 5 star reviews i suggest you check out what other albums/artists they reveiwed - it sfunny how the reviwer who has the most helpful votes on this album also gave robbie williams and take that 5 stars.    think wisley before you start paying attention to all these 5 star ratingas - they are very 'throwaway'.    i know music is subjective - but if you think this is as good as it gets - tyhen you really, desperately need to expand your musical horizons coz there are so many band out there who have done or are doing similar things  much more succesfuly.    sorry elbow - sorry elbow fans - time for some home truths.    its ok you can go click on 'no' now....    thanks for listening.",0

"Memory Lane Tripped Up Bought this as had notion to hear (very) long version of Green Grass and High Tides (their \\""""Freebird\\"""") after coming across the (superior) Album version in a compilation playing in a coffee shop ; 20 minutes and over twice as long but not as good.<br />Bought the Vinyl LP but lent it to someone, forget who and they will have forgotten they were supposed to return it ( I think we both discovered Punk and so Outlaws became passe)<br />Production cries out for a remaster; some of the stronger songs have held up well but patchy sound quality isn't kind to the weaker material.

"OK ish. Great concept but falls short of what we normally come to expect from the Foo's.  I think the first and last songs are good, the rest are just album fillers.  Dave would have been better to do this sort of thing as a solo project, maybe that would have been far more impressive.  I hate to run down anything the Foo Fighters do, I've loved their stuff for years, maybe this album is more for people who are new to them and will use this as a gateway to the rest of their fine body of work.",0

"Meh... Now, I am a long time fan of the Angry Birds series. But this particular one was a bit of a let down. I mean, the app is ok, the graphics are cute, and the gameplay is nice. The app is big but I guess it does have a lot of data to load. Now, onto the bad.<br /><br />There is a constant feeling that you have to buy a lot of things to actually enjoy this game. After five races your bird gets 'too tired' to race anymore and you have to either pay real money to race again or wait for it to recharge. Now, I don't mind there being micro-transactions in games but ones that limit the amount of time you can actually play the game really annoy me. I find 'energy' systems in games are just really bad and blatantly money-grabbing. (If you've spent any amount of time at all playing any of the typical Facebook games then you will perhaps be familiar with this type of system.)<br /><br />With the original Angry Birds games you could play for as long as you wanted to without be constantly badgered into buying additional items. But it happens in this game... after every race!<br /><br />Now, I didn't buy anything in this game but, if for whatever reason you decide to, then be prepared to reach into your wallet as it can be really expensive. There is some item in this game (a cart or something I think it was) that you can buy... for 70 pounds. That's right, 70 British pounds. SEVENTY. Who in their right mind is going to pay 70 pounds on a mobile phone app!? Geez...<br /><br />And that's the main problem with this game. This is nothing but a cash shop on wheels.<br /><br />The other Angry Birds games (the traditional ones as well as the RPG one) are quite a bit better in my opinion.",0

"Yet to be convinced.... This new 3DD album was recommended to me by a friend and on listenning to the trailers, it seemed to be something possibly special. However, having bought this and listenned to it a number of times, I am not that sure about the quality of this album. I am concerned that, like 'Theory of a dead man', there seems to be a tendancy to go all mainstream and be too close to the stock 'Nickelback' style music. Yes, there are some treasures - like the title track, but too many are mediocre at best. You could lift a number of these tracks and plonk them on a Nickelback album, which is a shame. I wanted something different - 'Time of My life' track promises post-grunge combined with classic heavy rock, yet the tracks that follow simply dont hold up as anything new or interesting. When you see bands of real talent call it a day due to lack of commercial success (like Audioslave), you fear that so many others sacrifice doing something different to ensure sales. An opportunity missed, I am afraid.",0

"Expected a lot more A friend with similar literary intrests highly recomended me to read this book. I don't know if it was the excess of expectation, but I spent most of the book thinking: \\""""No. This is really bad, but the best is yet to come\\"""". However, when I realized it, I was finishing the last page and it never got better.  This novel has a bunch of crazy caracters inside non-sense storyline. It's fun to read many parts, but you must keep a real open mind for it's surrealist environment.  The hidden messages and metaphors just didn't do it for me.",0
"Complete rubbish Being an ardent fan of Labyrinth, which this film has been compared to- I was expecting a modern interpretation with something new and exciting put into the mix. The music running throughout is irritating and even though the cast is decent enough, I switched off after half an hour. Thoroughly disapointed and bored. The script lacked depth and there was too much CGI.The magic of what fantasy classics such as Legend, Never ending story and Labyrinth had just wasnt in this. A waste of my money.",0

"A wistful, clunky collection of pseudo-sophisticated observations - painful and utterly vacant. This vapid, ponderous brain fart is essentially a poor re-telling of Good Omens in a counter-factual Nazi Germany. Sadly, not a counter-factual Nazi Germany in the same vein as Robert Harris' Fatherland, or even that novel's poor cousin, C J Sansom's Dominion.<br /><br />No, this is counter-factual in the sense that it is lazy. There was never any snub by Hitler of Jesse Owens, based on race or otherwise. Ayran supremacy did not extend as far as deporting people with brown eyes solely on the basis of having brown eyes at any point. German economic resurgence was never as powerful as is coyly alluded to. At no point did Hitler command 90% of popular approval. Germany had already technically been at war for nearly three years, on numerous fronts, by September 1939.<br /><br />Secondly, the novel is a painful concoction of literary device. Orwellian newspeak categorization sits uncomfortably next to Dickensian tangents, themselves distilled into dreadful soliloquies. The worst, possibly, is the use of anthropomorphic allegory - within the first 30-ish pages we are confronted with the two gravediggers - one is Hitler, the other is the German People, as well as a car driver being the Final Solution. This isn't intelligent, it's incoherent.<br /><br />Such rich, fetid invention is poured awkwardly into a style which can only be described as a child's attempt at concrete prose.<br /><br />TL, DR? Don't bother. Go and read Eichmann in Jerusalem instead, followed by Goodnight Mr. Tom.",0

"A silly little book ... As an atheist, I was expecting to enjoy this book.  I am tired of the PC approach which holds that other people's beliefs, no matter how wrongheaded, dangerous or plain obnoxious should be \\""""tolerated\\"""" at all costs.  But Sam Harris fails to hit the spot.<br /><br />First of all, there is his ahistorical approach to Islam - basically that terrorism, suicide bombings etc can all be explained by looking no further than the pages of the Koran.  How very easy, and how much history is ignored of the rise of Islamism and the influence of European fascism and anti-Semitism on the Arab world etc etc etc.  No, in Harris' world all Muslims are irrevocably stuck in the i4th Century, Arab modernism never happened, now they're going to get hold of nukes and ... well, we're all doomed really.  Thanks, Sam.<br /><br />Some time after this we are treated to a little treatise in favour of the practice of torture.  This arises from the argument that the Western powers are morally superior to the evil Muslim suicide bombers because the \\""""collateral damage\\"""" (i.e. civilian deaths) caused by air bombing are \\""""unintentional\\"""", so if George Dubya had been able to get hold of a \\""""perfect weapon\\"""" that would avoid such casualties, then he would. (Hmm - now what about Hiroshima and Dresden, well never mind, let's go with him to see where he arrives...)  The next stop in the argument is that torturing terror subjects is not so horrible as killing civilians, so if we're prepared to tolerate \\""""collateral damage\\"""", then why not torture as well.  Ah - but hang on, surely the pain inflicted in torture is intentional and he's just invalidated his own argument?<br /><br />Then the book goes even further off the rails.  After trashing Gandhi (for his pacifism), Harris moves into a section extolling the benefits of Eastern religions vs. the Judaeo-Christian / Muslim tradition.  To support this, he quotes a navel-gazing chunk of Padmasambhava, an 8th Century Tibetan mystic.  Now, if you wanted to construct an argument about the baleful effects of religion on society, need you really look much farther than Tibet, which was almost literally trapped in the Middle Ages by its Buddhist theocracy until the Chinese invaded in the 1950s?  Harris claims that Eastern mysticism was way ahead of the West in its exploration of consciousness, but as a self-professed student of religion, is he really unaware of \\""""The Cloud of Unknowing\\"""" and similar texts that show that just the same sort of thing was taking place in the Christian tradition.  And, I gather in Sufism.<br /><br />If only the author had done his homework.  I think this book can only feed the flames it seeks to quell.  Jihadists in particular will pleased to know that their's is the only possible interpretation of the Koran.effects of religion on society, need you really look much farther than Tibet, which was almost literally trapped in the Middle Ages by its Buddhist theocracy until the Chinese invaded in the 1950s?

"Have a Nice day The young techno-inspired inhabitants of California are about as distant from me as some lost tribe. They have different ways of seeing the world and reach for the internet as a solution to life's every problem. The internet has everything at your fingrtips but technology has a way of bleaching out life's more immediate experiences, making it flatter. So, brilliantly we can sit at home and travel the world and learn about history, science, other cultures or wars in distant lands. But, I have a feeling that most westerners are interested in celebrity weddings. The vacuous and empty. Or porn.<br />One interesting concept that this book brought to me is the Singularity. This, I gather, is when artificial intelligence becomes greater than ours. The problem is that we can't imagine what that will be like because our intelligence is limited. It's like trying to imagine what life will be like in the year 3000. After you go through flying cars, the elimination of cancer and spaceships it's really hard to imagine the future beyond things that we aleady know.<br />Mr Penumbra started out as a 6000 word e-book and has been reworked into a papery book things. This is relevant to the story because it seems to be about the interface between old-world technology and new. A criticism levelled at the book is that it is aimed at young adults but I have read the Hunger Games and don't have a problem with books appealling to a wider audience. It is just sooo sunny, Californian, rock-climbing, low-carb, computer savvy, bright young things - it makes me feel a bit sick. But, I am an aging dinosaur heading for extinction....",0

"Not sure what the fuss is about I found the book to be well below the standard of good crime fiction. Ian Rankin's novels are practically war and peace compare to this one. For me it lacked suspense, although the plot had some ambition on the surface(ex KGB man, the journalist, murders, etc) and overall missed any sophistication. The only thing for me was some novelty in the style of the scandinavian writer... But hundreds of positive reviews- may be I'm missing something !",0

"Reasonable, but flawed There is no denying that the majority of advice is good and accurate, but it is difficult to see at which level of expertise this guide is pitched.  It does build quite well from the basic function of modern flash units to using modifiers.  However, the author tends to deal in model specific issues (Nikon and Canon) rather too much. Also, he dismisses the issue of 'noise' (the grainy effect seen in higher ISO shots) by suggesting modern cameras are exceptional. Well, his may be, but that won't be true for everyone and many people do not like 'noise' in their pictures. Consequently, in this respect, the vast majority of his examples are of questionable value (I would also question his use of 'gels' on flash for digital photography).  This book will help some people, on some levels, give misleading expectations on others, and can introduce the occasional extra confusion. Having said that, I think it can help to boost confidence by showing it is not too much of a 'dark art'!",0
"Does for books what Jeremy Kyle does for TV! I read it to find out what all the fuss was about & am happy to admit I won't be bothering with the other two books.

"Complete Disappointment Due to the acclaims given to this novel, I expected something truly unique; especially due to the interesting narrative - death. However, I couldn't be more disappointed if I tried.     I have read my fair share of books and I am also currently studying Nazi Germany, so I have some insight into Germany around the time in the novel. Before I delved into this book, I thought it sounded incredibly interesting; the narrative was different, the setting and date was at a time of interest and the mystery seemed to be lurking from the synopsis on the back. However, instead of feeling like I was connecting with the characters and enjoying the story line, I felt like I was being taught a History lesson into Nazi Germany all over again.     Now don't get me wrong, Zusak's style of writing was innovative and imaginative but I believe there was a lack of flow to the book. Especially with the, oh so many, parts.     The protagonist of the novel, Liesel; is a somewhat boring character compared to the likes of Max and her foster parents. I suspect many people will disagree when I say that the only relationship I found to be of any emotional meaning was between herself and Max, especially when they reunite towards the end. Oh, don't get me started about the end! What an anti-climax that was.    I never say time is wasted, because that is an impossibility, however I would have much preferred to have spent my time reading something more worthwhile. This book was a huge let down to the enormous amount of hype it received and I wouldn't recommend anyone to be put through the struggle of reading it.    Pick something else :)",0
"Great! This arrived in perfect condition and I can't wait to start reading it once my exams are over!

Clearly he has no clue about economics as evidenced by this book.  Some of what he writes is just doesn't make sense and is really difficult to read and he frequently gets cause and effect the wrong way round.  Many of his statements which he takes for facts with no evidence to back them up are either just wrong or don't make sense.<br /><br />If you want to get an understanding of this crisis then this book would not help you, look elsewhere.",0

"Not what I was expecting from and established author After hearing the audio drama of the short story murder mysteries I was eager to get my hands on some of Neil gaiman's work. I was hugely disappointed by this. If it was a children's book I could understand why some of the prose seems simple, but its clearly not intended for children. I thought the writing was bad and the terry pratchett style jokes awful. Could somebody direct me to some of his better work?",0
"Amazing I am biased in terms of the film as I already loved it before it came onto Blu- Ray(saw it in the cinema twice). Its different to all of the other Disney films as it doesn't follow the usual princess, prince fall in love format. The blu ray copy has an amazing picture, came in good time (although a day later than it was due) and in good packaging to protect in the post. Would recommend all to watch this film.",1
"Why the hell did I buy this CD? Let's not beat about the bush. This album is a pile of tripe. Some prat with a silly watch and some other guy are angry and shout a lot instead of inspiring people to change things for the better.<br />Maybe I'm too white and middle class to get what they are trying to say but whatever my social and economic background I just couldn't find any redeeming qualities in this album.<br />Don't get me wrong I love Public Enemy's song \\""""Fight the Power\\"""" but this album is just dire.",0
Five Stars Ok cd,1
"Not Great Not Bad Bought this after hearing Muse and was recommended it by a friend. I listened to the Album and to me there are only a few tracks worth listening to. Airbag, Karma Police and No Surprises which reminds me of Final Fantasy VII for some reason are great tracks don't get me wrong, but tracks such as Fitter Happier i mean what is that all about? Sorry to say but this Album isn't one of the greatest. In my book Muse are still more powerful and always will be. Thom Yorkes vocals are weak and get boring after a while.",0

"Conan the Uninspired Oh dear,where do we start?Well,to start with, I loved the original Schwarzenegger movie from 1982.It had sweeping spectacle,awesome cinematography,an incredible production design,a perfect cast and quite possibly the greatest movie score ever written by the late great Basil Poledouris.<br />This version,alas,has none of the above qualities.What it does have is a reasonable start,maybe the first 15-20 minutes is okay,but after that unfortunately degrades into a boring mess of a film that looks like a cross between the TV \\""""Hercules\\"""" series and a rather ropey \\""""Sinbad\\"""" movie.<br />Marcus Nispel is not a competent enough director for a film of this magnitude,and indeed if you look at the movies he has directed,you will soon see the words \\""""uninspired\\"""",\\""""lack-lustre\\"""",\\""""drab\\"""" and \\""""poor\\"""" attached to any of his work.<br />Jason Momoa,while undeniably a \\""""pretty boy\\"""",is no Conan.He lacks the screen-presence to carry a film like \\""""conan\\"""",and although he tries hard,he will never be an Arnold Schwarzenegger or indeed the Conan created by the late Frank Frazetta's masterpieces.<br />If only John Milius (who directed the original film)had been attached,then we would've had a movie to get excited about.As it happens,we have an over-violent,boring,damp-squib of a film.<br />I personally found it difficult to stay awake after an hour of watching this disappointing mess.<br />Such a shame,and a deeply wasted opportunity.Come back Arnold,get hold of John Milius and let's see \\""""King Conan,crown of Iron\\"""".A truly proper Conan movie that we all want to see!",0

disappointed with stephen kings it dvd Bit disappointed. When it said 2006 in brackets i thought it was a much newer version of the old 90s mini-series but its the same. It should state that its the old version. It adds to my stephen king collection though even if i don't actually watch it!,0
"Disappointing This is something of a ragbag ranging far and wide over neuroscience, consciousness, intelligence, mental illness, mind control, dreams, NDE, robotics/artificial intelligence, aliens and a good deal of futurology. Any one of these topics might have justified a book from this author, but what we get here is mainly a series of superficial commentaries.<br /><br />As far as any persistent themes can be detected, these seem to revolve round consciousness and the development of robotics/artificial intelligence. The theory of consciousness suggested here is really only half a theory, giving consciousness the function of providing models of the future, without explaining either why such models require consciousness, or how consciousness might arise in the first place.<br /><br />The exploration of robotics and artificial intelligence is similarly unsatisfactory. The lack of any progress to date in producing properly autonomous robots is detailed. It is noted how the much-hyped Watson computer appears to lack any capacity for appreciating its own sucess, or socialising with the humans around it. Nevertheless, after describing all this, the author still follows the party line of projecting forward to the triumph of AI/robotics without much suggestion of why the future will be more successful than the past.<br /><br />Perhaps these shortcomings are at least partly redeemed by an insight at the very beginning of the book, where it is suggested that the introduction of brain scanning since the 1990s is as significant as the invention of the telescope for the scientific understanding of our world.",0
Purchase of Kylie Monogues Cd It is difficult to write a review as I purchased the cd for a relative as a birthday present.  I have not been told how it was rated.  I am sure if it was my purchase I would be very pleased with it as I am a fan of Kylie Monogue.,0
Five Stars Excellent cd and delivered on time and at a great price.,1
"This makes me sad a really poor sequel - Hit-Girl (for me the main character) is not even 10 minutes on-screen - MotherF just looks stupid - and the fun is kinda gone - and violent? yeah, it is, for about 10 minutes (see above), the rest not so much...",0
A complete waste of money I feel compelled to advise you NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK!!! I did not enjoyed reading it; the plot is amateuristic and utterly boring. There is not any progression in the relationships that Jane Austen so worderfully developed in Pride and Prejudice and the writer's attempts to make it interesting are totally unsuccessful.,0
Five Stars the best,1

"Donna at her best. I think this is the best of the author's three books. Despite the length, (sections could have been subjected to surgery without the loss of any vital organs) I was rivetted throughout. The author has a unique way with words and never a cliche in sight. A very enjoyable read.",1

"I shall highly recommend this book for all Michael Jackson fans. I have not read this book as of yet; however I have heard so many great things about Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy, written by Dr. Karen Moriarty--a book that explains, vindicates, and celebrates Michael Jackson!<br />Thomas A. Mesereau [MJ's defense attorney] endorses this book:<br />\\""""If you want an eye-opening portrayal of the real Michael Jackson -<br />delivered in a rare blend of disclosure, respect, insight, and passion - this is it!\\"""" That statement and the title alone caught my attention on wanting to order this book about \\""""The King Of Pop\\"""" Michael Jackson.. As a child--oldest of six children and parents not being able to afford to buy posters or magazines for me as a child-- I had a desire to learn more growing up about M.J. but never had the chance; now I do . Michael Jackson was a proud man from things I have read so far in Dr. Karen Moriarty's postings on her Facebook site. Knowing his passion to please his fans and bring more to the earth, Dr. Karen Moriarty shows that M.J. truly loved children of this world. I for one will never believe the gossip people say about him!!!! He was humble and spent money he made for children less fortunate and visited sickly children in the hospital. Yes, Michael Jackson was a great man. I believe all of his fans love him and miss him . I am honored to buy this book by Dr. Karen Moriarty. I truly believe she had a great insight into the King of Pop, like she knew the big star not only by his fame but his soul as a person. Will write more after I read the book.... From a fan most excited beyond belief !!!!!!! \\""""I shall highly recommend this book for all Michael Jackson fans.\\"""" >>>>> Lora",1

"Where are the extras?! Loved this movie in the cinema. It is a bit of a no-brain-required action flick. The lossless audio is outstanding for anyone with a 5.1 system. Also, not keen on the grainy filter used, I prefer my high-def picture to be crisp and clean (e.g. Dark Knight)<br />My biggest gripe with this release is the lack of additional content, even Superman Returns has more. Very disappointed, considering this was the more expensive Blu-ray option<br /><br />Lost a star for being just a good movie, not amazing<br />Lost a star for lack of additional content.",0

"Uninspired and dreary I had high expectations when I received the book but was bitterly disappointed.<br />I am sure Ms. Heilbron was a formidable person and a brilliant lawyer, it is a pity that her biography was not written by someone with the same talent in writing.<br />The entire book is an endless and rather boring list of court cases presented without any insight or interest for that matter.<br />It would have been interesting to read what inspired Ms. Heilbron or gain insights into her thinking, instead the reader is constantly reassured that she was also a good and homely wife and mother and the author seems almost apologetic about the fact that Rose Heilbron was a brilliant professional.<br />I do not think this book does the person Rose Heilbron any justice and was very uninteresting to read",0
"what could have been... Ahh, so frustrating. On  the surface this appears to be an improvement on th  original, but for a few things. The lagging is horrible, I shouldn't need t o play on a lower setting for the game to perform well.<br />The swinging mechanics are a step backwards, you need to hold the jump button which gives no control over the height of your jumps, in the original you had to double press jump to swing and it was much better.<br />The daily bugle collectibles! Worst. Placed. Collectibles. EVER. The new swinging doesn't help, either.<br />Such a shame because other areas like story and mission progression are much better.<br />Also, no upgrading unless you buy stupidly overpriced suits? No thanks.<br />Fix the lagging and give us an option to use the original swing method and stop fleecing customers with add-ons and this could be great.",0

Predictably Irrational Interesting book. I will read it again before I make a final decision on it's worth.,0
"Neither Jane Austen nor PD James I may be the only person in the world who feels this, judging by the reviews, but I was very disappointed. I am a fan of PD James's Adam Dalgleish stories and a lover of English Literature, but this attempt to combine the two has resulted in a stiff and unconvincing murder story. Paying homage to Jane Austen has made Austen seem snobbish and limited because her sharp satirical eye is missing. Self indulgent of Baroness James, but then she is allowed to do what she wants at her age!",0

It is a bit of a slog to get through, and I wouldn't say it held my interest all the time, but it is interesting in parts. I'm not a real fan of these 'journeys of discovery', but I admire her nerve and daring to do such a walk; especially alone and genuinely hope it helped her to come to terms with the tragedies and events in her life, but I personally found it a little tiring.",0

"No No and thrice No! Is it me or are my heroes deliberately out to upset me? If it wasn't bad enough that Queensryche released a total stinker of an album in Dedicated to Chaos, then Primus ... by beloved Primus presented us with their latest patchy (at best) offering Green Naugahyde. Now the mighty Opeth have raised my blood pressure by going so prog, that it can only be enjoyed sitting on a raffia mat in the lotus position surrounded by lava lamps and the aroma of stale petula oil! In fact it's so 70s' prog that after just one listening I was dreaming about Ford Escorts, Man about the House and Pan's People!     So Michael has finally gone and done it, realizing his fantasy by obliterating any traces of Opeth's Death Metal origins, fusing together the sounds and styles of prog rock legends such as Camel, King Crimson, early Yes, Deep Purple, Jethro Tull and Gentle Giant into one big pair of purple loon pants.      Heritage is not for faint hearted readers of MetalHammer. It is slow, meandering, trippy, self-indulgent codswallop. The album starts and finishes with lifeless instrumental dirges, the tracks in between merging into one globular nonentity with tracks like 'Folklore' merely an Andy Latimer reject.     The album's only glimmer of hope is 'Slither', but even this is dashed when the ghost of Blackmore appears to drag it back to pre-decimalization. Now I'm not some leather-clad, white-face painted death metalhead and I do like the aforementioned bands, especially Camel ... but not on a damn Opeth album! It's that light and shade that made Opeth ... Opeth.     I suppose I could see it coming on Watershed, but not to the extent that I am left with a load of well produced, well recorded, well packaged ... tosh.     Talking of Tosh, if I read an interview that says he's now listening to reggae I'm outta here!",0
"Well at least this got me into the musical... I first watched this film when i was about 8-10, and i was amazed and stunned of how beautiful it was. I thought it was one of my favourite films.  But then i turned 15 and i saw the 25th anniversary and that completely blew me away. The singing was a hell of a lot better, the acting and effects!  Bad parts of movie  Emmy rossum cannot act for s***. She just gives that same dazed expression which after a while really angers you why she got the role! Don't get me wrong, she has the perfect look of Christine, but she just cant act! Her singing was good, but i heard her voice was digitally enhanced which misses the whole of a musical...i mean its not a pop song!  Gerard Butler is a great actor, but his voice had no comparison to Ramins, JOJ and many others. And the phantoms deformity is terrible, it looks like hes had a mild sunburn or something. Really bad. It just makes the idea of a 'haunted face' being 'distorted deformed it was hardly a face' seem stupid.  There was also a lot of costume changes made too, which annoyed me more. Why did they change the Think of Me dress to a white wedding gown? The Point of no return dress to some slinky tart dress? Or the phantoms red death costume which was really pussied out. It just winds me up!    However if it weren't for this film it would have got me into the actual musical so thats why i gave it 3.",0
"Seriously NO This album is a joke. I don't have a problem with the fact that it's more hard rock over thrash but it is simply boring and seriously lacks the energy or sophistication of their earlier work. The worst thing is the lyrics. In places it's like they were written by a 10 year old.  \\""""Burn, baby, burn... 'cause it feels so good  Burn, baby, burn... like I knew it would\\""""  Is the sort of thing I would expect a boy band to sing! The album just feels immature. Kingmaker is a rip off of children of the grave and how Mustain was satisfied after recording the chessy Dance in the Rain is beyond me. This is Megadeath's St. Anger. I feel sorry for the People at Bloodstock festival next year if they play this rubbish.",0

"Oh dear... This was my first Kinsella read - or Wickham!  It wasn't a bad story actually. However,what disappointed me was the continual use of the 'F' word.  I could stumble my way through the typos that popped up rather frequently but all the swearing really grated on me.  The occasional use of 'bad' language in a book can make a story realistic - you can't continually have characters saying \\""""Oh bother!\\"""" I suppose - but this was ridiculous and really detrimental to an okay read.",0
"Quite Long Winded Next to The Affair, Without Fail, for me, not one of Child's best Reacher novels. I felt the book started very well when Reacher is asked by a NSA operative, known as Froleich, to conduct a security audit and test the resolve the Vice President's security detail. The VP does a few social occasions in public places over the next few days and Froleich is left thinking, where's Reacher? Why hasn't he tried to infiltrate the VP's security? It's great when you find out that, oh yes, Reacher was there in the background all the time and the VP could of been assassinated 3 and half times. I enjoyed that part a lot. Then the middle of the book I felt was very long winded with sub plots leading to nowhere. The VP gets a few threatening letters, intercepted by the NSA of course. The letters are investigated and it just drags on and on with no real answers and theories being thrown around which leave the reader getting a bit frustrated. Someone wants to assassinate the VP, but why go to all the trouble of sending warning letters, why not just say nothing and then just do it unannounced, that's where I felt the story lacked realism. The end part of the book is quite good and finally we find out who the suspects are and yes like all Reacher books you can expect and thrilling shoot out with Reacher looking to settle a score. The Book was okay but too long winded in places I felt.",0
"What i think of Hannah Montana Even though I'm a 17 year old female, I would recommend this film. It is a great reminder of how Miley Cyrus used to be. It is a great family movie. Iv watched it like 100 times, and I have never once got bored of it :)",1
"Never again! I enjoyed Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, read in that order so thought this might be worth ago.  However, from page 1 I struggled to get into it but a guy in the book club said it was his best yet and he couldn't put it down, so I thought I must carry on and see what I'm missing.    When I got to the last page I was just relieved as I was irritated all the way through.  It was by far 300 pages too long.  It was almost like it was his first book by the way it was written and the shallowness and predictability of his characters.  The baddie was evil but I never totally got the point of what he was after and why.  Robert Langdon wasn't very likeable as wouldn't believe anything he was being told.  I don't want to give anything away, but the rest of the characters annoyed me too.      I'm done with Dan Brown.  It's a shame as I enjoy this type of mystery book but there seem to be a few more writers on the block now so move over Robert Langdon, you're old news!",0
"I want to be clear about the fact that I really enjoyed this book and read it in just one sitting First of all, I want to be clear about the fact that I really enjoyed this book and read it in just one sitting. It was well-written (as you'd obviously expect from any published novel but sadly I have read so many poorly written books lately that 'well-written' is a slight surprise!), the plot was mostly interesting, intriguing, and likeable, as were most of the characters most of the time. I especially liked Cath's roommate (I can't remember her name) and her eventual love interest (forgotten his name too!). However, there are many reasons I cannot give it more than three stars.<br /><br />1) I found Cath really quite irritating. Finding a character doesn't have to be a negative thing about the book, but at times I found Cath's negativity really annoying. There's this one point where a fellow new, and likely equally shy and lonely female student smiles and seems eager to start a conversation and Cath just blanks her. Cath, who is too shy to find out where the cafeteria is, Cath who moans about being alone. It just seemed really stupid and unrealistic to me, if we're going along with the idea we're forced to have throughout that Cath is just shy and too used to living in her twin sister's shadow, then it seems absurd that Cath would push people away like this. I am a very shy person, yet when I first started at university I made a point to smile, start conversations, and invite and include others along to things I wanted to do or places I wanted to go. It's just something you have to do, and it's something that I found most did. Unrealistic.<br />Cath did grow as a character later on, but those initial parts were just painful. And yes, you could argue that some people are silly and just ruin things for themselves and are so shy they become self-destructive, but it just seemed ridiculous to me, especially after going through the whole moving into university thing myself. Another thing that annoyed me about Cath was how preachy she was about drinking. The author waspreachy too, and I will cover this in my next point.<br /><br />2)The anti-alcohol message. Maybe this is because I'm very English and this book could be seen as very American, and because in England we have an often negative 'drinking culture' in our universities and daily lives etc which is very different to many mainstream American attitudes to drinking. Regardless, I found the emphasis on Wren's drinking 'problem' unbeliavably annoying, not to mention completely unnecessary. The story would have worked just as well, better in fact, without the drinking plot. Wren goes out and gets wasted with her friends. There are I think two instances where this goes very wrong. If I remember rightly, the first is when she gets in a dangerous situation with some boys/men. Now, obviously I would never ever make light of sexual assault/harassment , but it felt like the author was. It felt like there was victim-blaming happening, like the author was saying 'look at this situation Wren has put herself in because she's drunk, Cath doesn't drink and look at how she's safe and so much better in every other way'. And I found that kind of disgusting.<br />The second instance was I think when Wren has to get her stomach pumped. Now this is of course terrible and an indicator that one should definitely be drinking less! And I don't have too much of a problem with this, except for the fact that the message overall is one of complete sobriety, that drinking alcohol is bad, dangerous, and damaging. There was no grey. And in reality there is grey. In my first term of university I met only two people who 100% don't drink. And that is fine, it really is. No one has any problem with them not drinking, and they have no problem with others drinking. It just felt like Rainbow Rowell was completely against any kind of drinking, and that felt really annoying and preachy to me.",0

PRR have created their own unique sound which has a taste of Pink Floyd to it. Its generally all music and very catchy if your in the mood for some alternative Floyd. Saw them live which lead me to buying the album, not a disappointing purchase.",0

"Should maybe read the book first This only grabbed me because the Wachowski name was attached to it, otherwise it would have passed me by. Within an hour I wish it had.<br /><br />You can't deny it's grand and epic ambitions, however it's over long, over complicated and fundamentally boring. Not having read the book, Cloud Atlas as a movie is very disappointing. It has some visual flare and a few interesting ideas but not enough to keep it from drowning in it's own pretentious silliness.<br /><br />With exception of the fantastic music score and some of the performances, there's neither anything ground breaking, innovative or interesting here. It's hard to believe that this was put together by the same team that brought us the marvellous Matrix trilogy. Unlike the Wachowski's Matrix masterpiece, Cloud Atlas will date badly and disappear from our memories very quickly.<br /><br />The six stories on offer are clumsily interwoven, polarizing and frustrating in execution. Maybe if I'd read the Mitchell book of the same name It may have forced me to pay more attention despite it's obvious flaws.<br /><br />But in the end and as a stand alone movie, it was all too baffling for me to care about it.",0

"passione This is the first andrea bocelli cd I didn't like. I have all his cd's and have always looked forward to his new releases. He's gone too &#34;middle of the road&#34; now, with too many songs in English, he sounds MUCH better in Italian.  I won't be buying any more.",0
"Not quite enough Fast paced, full of technical information, but at the end of the day it lacked the human touch. Sure the main character had a sense of dark humor about his life threatening predicament but when the story ended I really didn't know anything much about him. There was no reflection upon his life on earth, his family, friends or loves past or present. I sometimes felt that he went from one disaster to the next in a sort of oh well here we go again shrug of the shoulders acceptance. I even found myself becoming nonchalant, knowing that he would quickly find a way to overcome his latest disaster and carry on with his journey to meet his rescuers. As I turned the end page I felt sadly cheated, it could have offered so much but on reflection it did not offer enough.",0

"Where was her Editor? The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars is that I have a lot of respect for anyone who can write a book and the premise of the book had incredible promise.  This 450 page book would have been so much better if it had been cut down to a nice, tight, 250 page thriller. I really wonder if this writer has any honest friends or a decent editor in her life.   There are a lot of 5 star reviews so I will leave the outline of the story to those who loved it and just say that if you're the kind of person who really resents getting to the end of a book and thinking, \\""""that was a waste of a great idea\\"""" then think twice before wading through this mess.",0

"What's the big deal? I bought this album in the early '90s. I can't remember which year exactly, but the vastly overrated 'black' album was already out, and i wanted something a little heavier and faster than that. I'd just recently got into metal, and my tastes were getting less tame. Knowing the classic One was on this album, my expectations weren't low, but i was disappointed, and years as a metal head haven't changed my view. People can 'rate' my review as unhelpful as much as they want. Not being someone who cares about such nonsensical ratings, it matters not a jot; bottom line for me personally; this album is so boring. It's a heavy album, yeah. That doesn't make it one that isn't full of snores and some really dull songs. Never understood the hype around this album. personally, i think it's one of their worst.",0

"It was ok I rented this on Blu ray before i decided whether to buy it or not, having not read the book i was not familiar with the story.<br />For some reason i thought it was a musical. It didn't live up to expectations for me, the direction from Baz Lutherman was a little<br />strange and mishandled. There were only two scenes that i thought were good. J Gatsby holds lavish parties at his home for New Yorker's, which was not fully portrayed in this adaptation, i think i saw two parties at his manor in total. Something was missing from Leo's performance.  It looked nice in bluray but i will not be rushing out to buy my own copy.",0

"GIVES DIAMONDS AND GOLDENGUN A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY!!! \\"""" The best Bond ever \\""""<br />\\"""" This film is actually very very funny\\""""<br />\\"""" Action packed, moves at such a pace, thrill-a-minute\\""""<br /><br />So wrote the 4 & 5 star reviews. Add a very healthy 90+ score on RottenTomatoes, breaking box office records Worldwide, a Bafta award - who'd of thought!!..i'ts like Bond's heyday mid 60's with Goldfinger and Thunderball. Any Bond fans dream..at last Bond is receiving the adolation and the audience he deserves...it's now COOL to be a Bond fan...COOL to be British!<br /><br />Surely based on all the above - this film MUST deliver, packing a punch, exciting action,spectacular set-pieces, a tight thriller keeping it's audience on edge of their seat..'Thunderball', 'The Spy' for this generation. Well, if you thought any of that then you couldnt be more wrong. And this honestly comes from a lifelong Bond fan.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead..<br /><br />- OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE -<br />No gunbarrl sequence, go figure, good enough for 20 or more Bond movies & despite being the 50th anniversary...but what the heck I can live without that..anyway..turns out that's the very least of the movies problems.<br /><br />- Bond uses jetpack after fighting a tranny & climbs into his DB5 / Agents across the globe are killed off /  Bond skies off impossible cliff / Bond falls without parachute / Bond and the mircolight....you get the idea...highly original, well thought out stunts - starting any Bond movie off with a BANG.<br /><br />SKYFALL, 'the best Bond of all' ( so 'they' say ) starts off with a very pedestrian chase sequence & ends with a train fight. It was ok, fast-paced, felt the lingering advertising 'watch' shot shouldnt of been put in - in the middle of an action sequence!!! but heck..it started the film off on a good note. Octopussy did it better ( complete with 'bendable' swords!! ) and Segals 'Under Seige 2 did the train stuff better too..In fact rent any straight-to-dvd action movie and I've honestly seen better.<br /><br />SO - openingsequence was ok if a little flat..but heck it's not as bad as the lazy Diamonds Are Forever one...and at least I could see what was going on unlike 'Solace'!<br /><br />- Music/ Title sequence<br /><br />Title track did the job rather well I thought - yes it was sombre which is fair enough seeing as Bond had just been shot twice and fallen further than Zorin did in ViewtoaKill!...Goodluck with the Oscar Adele. The actual credit sequence however was...well it started alright, the hand pulling Bond down...but soon become repetitve, morbid, tombstones galore - a poor man's Live and Let Die ( now Liveletdie THAT was a song and credit sequence -wasnt it!! wow!!  ).<br /><br />Here was a perfect opportunity for a title sequence to of been more 'reflective' - Bond is dying, images of Bonds past together with how the hell he surives that fall! even if it is washed up on a beach. Heck, even Moonraker showed Moore in siloutte standing up after that parachute drop.<br /><br />Overall the film isn't going too badly - nowhere near classic status but I've seen worse.<br /><br />- Film opens proper.<br /><br />'Casino' started off with a fantastic fight sequence..Skyfall is the Best Bond Ever apparently so how is it going to top 'Casino'...well it doesnt even try too..it replaces any action with chat, long drawn out speeches by a constant flow of characters which the film won't let you care about. The cast it must be said were fantastic by and large - New 'M', Finney - Sam really got great performances out of them. Although 'Eve' ( I ask you ) Moneypenny was awful - the whole notion of her becoming Moneypenny from field agent..just didnt work.<br /><br />The CGI explosion on MI6 is ok..uninvolving at best though. The nature of the thing distances you from it, you never seen anyone killed - wheres the personal touch - how is the audience meant to get involved in this thing!<br /><br />Now, instead of showing a clip of Youtube with agents names released, 'think on your sins', wouldnt it of been great to have a Livletdie moment here...some agents killed in the field..so that 'this unseeable baddie' actually is seen to be a real threat. But, no..we just get the chat. About 20min of chat by this point but theres a sniff of an action scene to come...<br /><br />- The glass building.<br /><br />I'm going to ignore ALL the plotholes because for a film without a plot theres a bloody lot of them! Check out other viewers reviews on this, particular one chap, 2 star rated, who hit the nail on the head regards to plotholes. Actually, check out the amount of 1 and 2 stars reviews this movie has gained...over 50 of them thus far..boy!! thats a lot isnt it. What does that tell you I wonder.<br /><br />SO - Bond checks out our man at a glass building ( A hired 'professional' kills a guard in full view of a road etc...I'm no director but why film it like that - am I missing something? was it really intentional?..Bond is escapist nonesense so we don't have to tell you how he surives that fall, and we can shoot guards in full view..it's things like this makes me dislike the movie.<br /><br />So, Bond does a little Diamonds 'stunt' underneath the lift..A fisty-cuffs fight breaks out. For all of..erm...30seconds! A shame really that the lighting chap/director clearly more intersted in how the sequence looked than to concentrate on any actual action! Didnt this professional ass actually match Bond like for like in the pre-credit sequence...during a bike chase and a fight on a train as good as Bond..shame then within 30 seconds hes dead!<br /><br />Great  - 20min into the film proper and all we've had is action for 30seconds. No explination of how Bond surived that bloody fall!!  & a baddie who..well hasnt really done anything has he. Please check a movie called,DieHard ( 1988 23 years ago!!!! ) ..and you'll find more well staged action in 5minutes of that film than the entire 2half hours of this mess. Honest.<br /><br />- Casino<br /><br />More talk then - a nicely lit Casino sequence. Chitchat etc and then another fist fight for all of..yep! 30seconds again. Throw in a dimly lit 'dragon' sequance for all of another 30seconds..literally and erm..thats all your getting.<br /><br />- Bond girl No. 1 gives up her life for Bond.<br /><br />Bond beds women on boat..at this point I am assuming that a sequence has been scrapped.it must of been a very expensive scene because up to now this movie, creative lighting aside, is looking a little cheap. Bond beds this women to a shot of them tied up and being lead to Silvas island. Now - I know it's all part of Silvas plan to lead Bond to him and I know a Bond film has two Bond girls and usually one of them dies quickly..as in this case - the other being 'M'.  We now get a great little scene from Silva, the trouble is..it's a very long chatty scene and although it is a terrific neigh brillaint bit of saucy banter ( really is ) it comes at a time when we've just sat through so many speeches and introductions by so many characters including Bonds analyst ( not even a sexy one this time!! )..so..I for was was just begging the film to get to some action!!<br /><br />- Whiskey galore<br /><br />FINALLY the movie has a feel about it, it's gonna get good -  And it almost does..the scene with the whisky cup on her head. For 3 minutes it's an involving scene. Up to now we've just followed this tired looking Sid James crossed with Steve McQueen characteraround various nicely lit locations( it's a good look and actually he does have a very McQueen way about him ). But we havent been allowed to be involved in anything that's actually gone on.<br /><br />- MI6 going underground<br /><br />Back at makeshift MI6 - aka Silence of the Lambs...yawn...Q - brains! of the organisation - unbelivabily!!!! attaches Silva's laptop to the MI6 network...hell breaks loose. On the plus side the film continues to make good on the whiskey sequence and picks up - actually does have a PACE about it.<br /><br />-Tubestation /  Courtroom<br /><br />Tubestation chase ensues...and for about 10 minutes I'm finally watching an action movie. Theres a funny line about here too, 'He's in a hurry to get home'. It's a funny line...it's ONE funny line, 2 - if you count M's \\"""" ..well your bloody not staying here' and ok..3 if you include ' go-on then eject me \\"""" . Hardly worthy of newspaper hacks calling it 'a funny movie' though..rest of it is Bond scowling around the place..again looking..as others have said..ill...old...tired..bored...focus on the blue eyes..the blue eyes...<br /><br />So..we're what - 1hr 30min in, we've had...a train fight, 2 fist fights, a tube crash ( bad! cgi! they didnt even have the balls to make the carriage full of people!!..empty at rushhour!! come on!!...again..lack of involvment for us the audience...totally pointless effect that crash, also illogical..I mean..it all rested on Silva knowing where Bond was going to be standing and besides he missed! And now we get a poem...<br /><br />The courthouse scene is nicely done, love the poem as its spoken and Bond running the streets of London..nice shootout here too.<br /><br />- Back in time<br /><br />Personally, unlike a lot of newspaper reviews who said the 3rd act loses pace -  I don't feel the film does at all. Perhaps because aside from about 10mins the film never gathered any pace! - Up to now the audience has been totally lost - taken a back seat and involved in little of what's taken place - action has been lacking, the villain totally underused and the plot is thread bare..but the scottish landscape is nice to look at and heck I admire the makers for giving the 3rd act of this Bond movie a differnt feel.<br /><br />Ok so it becomes Homealone...with the highlight being M boobytrapping lightbulbs - I ask you!! Who wrote this..I feel insulted! I want my money back. But by this point I'm sitting in the cinema feeling really saddened that this movie just isn't delivering...i believed the hype - again!  And honestlythe audiences I were with ( on 3 separate occassions ) I sensed they felt the same...the snoring from the back gave the game away on one occasion. Serious.<br /><br />The ending, action wise, lighting etc..was ok...made zero sense but that's irrelevant at this point. It's a good job that helicopter and grenages didnt damage M..as Silva did want a personal kill didnt he...took a risk there. Best scene in the movie - by a mile - the long drumroll of the Bond theme as his DB5 explodes. Great..classic movie. But..way too little and way too late to make this movie any good I'm sorry to report.<br /><br />And so the film ends..Bond essentially killing M ( clearly his idea of being 'one step ahead' wasnt the right one then! ) however he gets a pat on the back by the new M and back in service despite failing all of the tests. The audience I was with all leaving there seats BEFORE Bond does his gunbarrell walk. Movie ends, giving us about 40minutes of unoriginal action..and the rest is all chat which was never great because the movie never allowed you in.  Best Bond ever...give me a break.<br /><br />To All these 5 star reviews..come off it. I can only come to this conclusion...that BOND has become part of the ESTABLISHMENT, that having the 'Queen's endoresment mid Summer 2012 and having a 'posh director' on board complete with a script which allows a poem read out whilst 'action' occurs - all this adds up to giving so-called reviewers a licence to hand Bond that extra 1 or 2 star reviews.<br /><br />Can I just state, I love Bond movies, I've seen them all many many times - most on the big screen, I have the blurray boxset, Ive even seen this traversty 3x at the cinema...this is NOT a Bond movie..it really isnt...its a Sam Mendas movie...and not a very good one at that.<br /><br />There is SO MUCH wrong with this it really is a case of banging ones head against the wall...so painfully plotted..it's almost like they didn't even try with this one it's just so linear. Or perhaps..they tried too hard to make it work and in the process forgot the basics of an action thriller...you need action and thrills! This film should of been the biggest turkey of the year - of the Bond franchise - thank God for the Queen hey! For once Her Maj saves Bond!!!<br /><br />Of all the Bond movies this was the one which didnt deserve to do the business...I really think the next one will suffer for this one being such a disappointment. Mendas can hold up his Bafta and proclaim, 'to the next 50yrs' but I can't help feel that this film is the one which will be Bonds nemisis..time will not be kind and audiences will see it for the bore-fest it rightly is..and hence Bond24 will suffer for it. I mean, im a Bond fan and I felt conned!<br /><br />This movie will be purchased to complete my Bond set..Im a fan as I say. But, like Diamonds and Goldengun it won't be watched very often. What pains me..what totally staggers me are all these fantastic reviews....I'm stumped! perplexed.<br /><br />Russia,Goldfinger,Liveletdie,Spy,Moon ( look it was fun! ), Eyes,LicencetoKill,Goldeneye,Tomorrow,Casino.... no contest...lightyears apart. However, Diamonds,Goldengun...well..Skyfall doesnt even deseve to be ranked among those!!",0

"Too many similarities :( I had previously read Clare's other series, the Infernal Devices, and I loved it. Hence, I decided to give the Mortal Instruments a go. I was greatly disappointed, the Infernal Devices and the Mortal Instruments had too many similarities.<br />Pretty girl falls in love with the good-looking, arrogant guy- check.<br />Then pretty girl is torn between choosing her best friend or the mysterious guy- check.<br />There is an evil villan, trying to build an army- check.<br />They are shadow hunters, who live in an institute, which is a church- check.<br />They have a cat called church- check.<br />Even the main characters names are similar- Clarissa(Clary) Fray and Theresa(Tessa) Gray.<br />Actually, I think that one of the only differences is that the Infernal Devices are set in the past- which makes the book more interesting.<br />My advice, just read the Infernal Devices, as the Mortal Instruments is just a less interesting copy of it.",0

"A real slog to finish this book - very disappointing Over the last few books, I've started to feel as if Baldacci is losing the plot (pun intended). This book confirmed that belief. Considering the fact that so many people die, it is exceptionally dull and devoid of any real action. Chapter after short chapter is just talk or characters moving from one location to another in hopeless pursuit of some seemingly all-knowing enemy. By a third of the way through the book it was already becoming a chore to carry on and after half way it became a battle - always in the hope that the Baldacci of old would suddenly up the tempo and introduce some real activity. Also, the Camel Club isn't really all that involved anyway, it's mostly Stone and an MI6 agent, Chapman, against the rest.<br /><br />No, sorry, this is a poor effort that was written, I suspect, to re-ignite flagging interest in Baldacci's increasingly disappointing writings. It would have been far better to have left the Camel Club in retirement and spent some time developing a much stronger storyline.<br /><br />My advice? - Don't be seduced by the thought of another classic Camel story because this most definitely isn't it.",0

"It's not good enough boys! Use your talent Keane are an interesting band. They started off with a fantastic piano sound with some brilliant songs and this progressed onto the 2nd album which is my favourite. The band took a left turn for the 3rd album Perfect symmetry, which the band saw as a celebration of their music and because they were a band again after nearly breaking up. They took a lot of risks and tried many new things, putting off a few of the fans with such a radical change in style. Then came Night train; an experimental EP with rapper K'naan, which was also pretty risky. This album is a return to a much more simple, no thrills, no risks style of music. It is predominantly piano music and is most reminiscent in terms of sound to the debut album. Even though I prefer the sound of this album to Perfect symmetry, that album had clever moments and wasn't afraid to try something different, I definitely can't say that for this album at all. Even though the music sounds similar to Hopes and Fears, the early material from the debut and second albums was so endearing, captivating and emotionally driven, connecting me as a listener and this album has very, very little of that bequest.<br /><br />The album's artwork says it all really - it's a scene of the seaside, taking a trip to the coast and is inspired by the band's early memories growing up. It's a nostalgic trip back to their roots. The whole album sounds to me like the soundtrack to a trip to the seaside!<br /><br />Besides a couple of the songs on the album that old Keane melancholy has been excluded from the songs. What connected me to the band as a listener was how I could relate to their lyrics about loneliness, sorrow and hoping for better. This album doesn't represent any of those things, at least they're certainly not prevalent. Funny thing is Under the iron sea was written when the band were not getting on and Tom was suffering with addiction and it is their best work to date. Now the band members are all married and seem satisfied with life the music suffers as a result and is very unexciting. There's no doubt that the best music is inspired by pain and unhappiness! Now I am not saying that the album is tedious or the songs are bad because they're not. All the songs sound nice and pleasant but pleasant isn't good enough! It serves much better as background music than as life music you sit down to listen to.<br /><br />Tom's voice is something I have to mention because even though it has improved from Perfect symmetry it still doesn't sound near as good as on the first 2 albums, not that it's bad at all because his voice is good just not as strong as it was.<br /><br />You are young irritated me to begin with because there were a number of songs in the charts about being young - Tulisa's Young and Fun's We are young and this song isn't that great but gets across that soft, warm feel of the album. I have heard so many of the songs used as background music on so many TV shows and it's no wonder why because the piano music is nice to listen to. When I 1st heard Silenced by the night I was unimpressed but it is one of the best on the album with a catchy chorus. I don't know about Disconnected; the verses are very low register vocally but the chorus is catchy. I like the subject matter and it's 1 of the better songs. Watch how you go reminds me of a Paul McCartney song, with it's slow sound and higher pitched vocals; it's quite different from the other tracks. Sovereign light cafe (I'm guessing a place from their past) is 1 of the best easily with it's very upbeat rhythm and catchy chorus. On the road is the most consistent feeling track with another catchy chorus and very upbeat sound; my favourite. The starting line slows things down, once again with Tom referring to someone who needs to pick themselves up as they move on. The verse is slow but the chorus is pretty robust and attractive. Black rain is where you get the feel for a sorrowful Keane sound (nostalgia!) with a mournful and interesting chorus.Neon river is my other favourite (probably because I can relate to the lyrics a lot) with great lyrics and subject matter about sticking around while this girl moves on. It has a faster rhythm. Day will come is pretty cool with an upbeat sound and a catchy chorus. It's another consistent song rhythmically with I like. In your own time slows things down, and is another song with Tom once again reaching out with his assistance. I like the lyrics and the overall sound. The intro reminds me of Journey - Don't stop believing! and I enjoy the breakdown in the bridge/middle 8 and how it comes back round to the chorus. Sea fog is the other melancholic tune with a slow pace and a mournful sound. It sets a mood for sure.<br /><br />The deluxe edition has 4 extra songs - Strangeland (why isn't the title track on the standard edition?!) is a slow paced song with lyrics about the past and a decent chorus with a good melody. Run with me is one of the best sounding songs here with a cracking, catchy chorus. Lyrically not incredible but it doesn't matter! The boys is not that good (lyrical content) but maintains that piano sound established in the album. It's not true is a slow, drudging track with quite a lacklustre sound throughout.<br /><br />Keane need to become inspired! I like that they've transferred to the piano sound again but it's far too safe. There's nothing on the album that really grabs me and makes me think. They're a shadow of their former selves.",0

"What a let down I had heard so much about this book and reading the first few chapters I had the same feeling that I experienced when reading 'Love in the Time of Cholera' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez-i.e.savour every page as this book will end.  However as you get further into the novel, you lose any interest in the characters and the central driving theme is near enough non-existent. There are simply too many of them and most of them have no real relevance to the development. I simply did not care for any of the characters by the end of the book. The problem could simply be the lenght of the book. The description of the slums are vivid but there is no need to keep repeating them everytime the central figure returns to them. We got the idea the first time, thank you very much! Anyway these slums are better described by Rushdie.    In the end I could not be bothered to read anything other than the dialogue knowing that the unread passages were uninformative.This book could have been a thrid the length and better for it.",0

"My inner goddess told me not to continue... I had initially stopped reading this halfway through, but ended up picking it up just to see whether I could get back into it. But within a few pages, I was reminded of why I stopped. Poorly written, repetitive use of phrases such as \\""""inner goddess\\"""" and very little happens other than the obvious (which also gets boring after a couple of times). I gave this a two star rating, as I got far enough to see that there was more of a storyline (albeit dull, unoriginal and uninteresting) and there seemed to be more character development (at least for Christian). But ultimately, the damage was done in the first book. I was silly to buy into the hype by getting all three books in one go, and whilst I wanted to finish so it was not a complete waste of money, all three books have now gone in a charity bag.",0

"A Major Disappointment Susan Hill's unremarkable tale of a malevolent ghost has surprisingly held theatre audiences spellbound for quite a few years in the West End, and contained at least one intense scare to give it word-of-mouth appeal amongst the masses.<br /><br />It was therefore a very good proposition to use the guy from the Harry Potter series and give it the newly rebooted Hammer Studios stamp of horror authenticity when launching it onto celluloid. Unfortunately, the result is woefully bad.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe may have shown some ability to play a schoolboy with a wand, but he is way out of his depth here cast as a recently widowed father who takes on the job of sorting out the will of a deceased old lady, and visits her supposedly haunted estate in the process. Radcliffe simply does not have the acting muscle or experience to convey the kind of grief and psychological depth required to authenticate this character's situation, and really struggles to do much more than hold a brimming tear in his eyes from time to time. He is also physically too immature to command the kind of presence to hold up the film, and cannot even sport stubble without the help of the make-up artist's boot polish. With such a weakness arising from the central miscasting, the film has a very hard time from the outset to convince the viewer that they are watching anything but a by-the-numbers thriller, which has a very clunky, average script, and production values that are not even up to Downton Abbey standards. There isn't even a supporting performance from any other cast member which makes up for the gaping hole in the middle, and all in all everyone involved seems sadly lacking in enthusiasm for the project.<br /><br />Performances aside, the original story had a major plot weakness in it and that weakness is painfully laid bare by the medium of film - without spoiling the plot for anyone who hasn't seen it, I'll just say it involves a car, a lot of mud, and a laughably inaccurate and unbelievable means of supposedly uncovering some evidence. Add to this a very questionable and depressing final scene, and you really are left with a very expensive mistake which might appeal to Radcliffe's undemanding teen fan-base, but will have an impossible task in convincing or involving thinking audiences.",0
"Sorry just dont get it I love all kinds of Americana/Country from George Jones, Willie, Merle, Cash etc to Lucinda Williams, Richmond Fontaine, Calexico, Justin Townes Earl, Ryan Adams/Whisky Town and many more., But I really struggle to get through this, it just sounds like middle of the road pop country to me. I have read great reviews on  amazon and Uncut magazine, but just not getting it.",0
Disappointed This is vastly overated.  I was really looking forward to watching this as when I went to the cinema to watch it it was a sell out.  Thank god  I didnt pay for it.  Very disappointed given the list of stars,0
"It's No 'City Of Evil'! This album did grow on me after a while. Now I've heard it enough times to review fairly I think it's a pretty poor album.<br /><br />After the band released 'City Of Evil' and eventually finished touring I couldn't wait for their next release. Unfortunately their next release wouldn't reach the hight of my expectations.<br /><br />The first song \\""""Critical Acclaim\\"""" gives the impression that the album may turn out to be more like \\""""Waking The Fallen\\"""", which in my opinion would be a good thing. But the next track \\""""Almost Easy\\"""" quickly gets rid of that idea.<br /><br />From track Two - Ten this album is extreme pop and that isn't what Avenged Sevenfold was or should be about.",0

Bad sound The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely satisfied with. I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too quickly. Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean. The less said about Anderszewski the better.,0

"BEST EVER I LOVE this film; it's juicy and is, possibly,the best film ever made-and I'd never heard of it til last week: 165 mins of brilliant directing, editing, acting etc. Some say they couldn';t understand it -- why not?It's all spelled out as this miraculous film unfolds. Watch it a few more times and all the subtle nuances grow. The only fault I could find was it wasn't long enough. How could critics pan it? They must be as thick as 2 short planks; it deserved at least half a dozen Oscars. I'm now going to read the book-- I hope it's as big a knock-out as the film.",1

the book was fantastic. I chose this rating because the book was fantastic.what disliked about this book was that Alfie's dad died but what i did like about it was that Winnie adopted him in the end.,1
goodly bad The videos work fine and all but when turn off screen it keeps the video running and so runs out the battery... very annoying please fix this,0
Lost opportunity..... Did I miss something here????  GREAT cast totally misused in this idiotic script!  I watched the beginning and then had to run it through  to watch it patchwork until the finale....  What a bore!!! Surely with such an accomplished  acting team this film should have been of much  higher quality! Don't waste your money.....or your  time!,0
mixed review This is a difficult one...I bought this as a gift for my beauiful step-daughter and she adores it. However I have read the first book and I cannot begin to understand the hype that has been created by such a seriously badly written book which is so predictable in content - but hey who am I to judge.......,0

"it's ok but sometimes slow rated it as ok as is slow sometimes, but is correct when you lokk out of window, use it a lot",0
"Not as good as it sounds I read all the other 5* reviews and got carried away believing this would be THE book; however it is long-winded with endless regurgitation of scientific facts, over and over again the same messages. Read these reviews to get the take-away message from the book and save yourself a few quid!",0
"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children Like a lot of people, I was drawn to this story by the creepy vintage photographs and the magical quality they evoke, despite the fact deep down you know the images are doctored. My intrigue was equalled by my doubt that a story which appeared to be constructed around such striking images could possibly feel organic. On this front it succeeds, as although whilst reading you are aware of the photo-ops coming up, I believe the story could still happily exist without the accompanying images. They aren't necessary, but since this device was what lured me to the book in the first place, I'm inclined to admire the artistic fusion of writing and photography to create an edgy hybrid. Bearing in mind the time period which much of the narrative refers back to, this wonderful twist on the picture book genre feels authentically of its time as a kind of rickety pre-film story.<br /><br />With that said, the things I really enjoyed about this book were its attention to detail in description and setting, and its characterization. I'm someone who thrives on carefully placed details, such as specific types of plant or architecture or simply well-realized images, to anchor me in a scene. I think this is because in our own memories we associate very specific and often insignificant objects, smells, emotions to particular past situations, and these small details have the power to evoke the entire scene. As someone who's never been either to the steamy climate of Florida, where the tale begins, or to the storm-riddled island it journeys to, these details were invaluable in involving me in the story.<br /><br />The characterization was pretty much as good as it could be in a single 350 page book--each character was engaging and unique, and as well as the oftentimes amusing clash between modernity and antiquity, I liked that the 'gifted' kids were given personalities above and beyond their powers. It instilled them with a sense of realism and quickened the time between discovery and acceptance on the protagonist's behalf. The romance between Jacob and Emma, and also between Emma and Jacob's grandfather, is handled with compassion and maturity and happily without a hint of condescension, self-pity or sentimentality. I also greatly enjoyed the portrayal of the islanders, how they dealt with boredom, their distrust of foreigners, etc. I loved the plot point of the gas generators being shut off at a certain time of night. There were a few red flags throughout as to who the villain may be, one of which culminating in a very grisly and disturbing (but in a good way) murder involving a local prehistoric man which I found extremely chilling and ghoulish (again, in a good way). It added to that supernatural/ghost story element and cemented the freaky isolation of the island.<br /><br />Things that disappointed me a little about the book were the inconsistency of its pacing as there seemed to be a lull in the middle and the way it was written made the end fairly easy to figure out well before it arrived; for this reason, I think the final act felt disjointed in places and lacked the suspence it might have had if the villain hadn't been so easy to spot.<br /><br />I'm ambivalent about the ending, as it is itself ambiguous. I'm not sure if there's a sequel coming or if this is intended as a standalone novel. If the former, I'm not sure I will be too bothered to pick the sequel up, and if the latter, well, the story is now all the more haunting.<br /><br />Overall, an odd and strangely memorable little novel, moving and thought-provoking in its themes and context. I wouldn't recommend you to dive into your nearest bookstore and buy a copy immediately, but if one sidled your way, sure, why not?tance on the protagonist's behalf.

"One is not convinced...one is amused. I thought this was hyped and it was. Helen Mirren played HM as best she could, but how does anyone, no matter how talented an actor, portray a character who never lets her guard down, who doesn`t give interviews and whose every move is a PR exercise? This film is probably close enough to what happened that terrible yet amazing summer, when the monarchy felt more pressure than it had since old Oliver Cromwell was King hunting in the seventeenth century. According to this, the Queen is a bit of a cold fish and had to be `persuaded`to show some respect by Tony Blair. Sounds feesible, yet there some massive liberties taken, including a ludicrous Deerhunter moment. Still, if you like these sorts of movies, with lookalikes a plenty, this one is as good as it gets. Although Mirren`s Queen isn`t a patch on Stanley Baxter`s, never mind Rory Bremner`s.",0

Five Stars One of the absolute best films ever made.,1
"Listen before you buy! This was high in my wants list of then deleted albums for years! While I could see the merits of most so called classic albums, the reputation of this one baffles me. For a start, despite its intriguing title and reputation, its not psychedelic at all, more a late 1965 beat group sound. Secondly the sound of the album is curiously inert and anaemic as if it it has all the life sucked out of it (the sound picture seems processed and unnatural). The Zombies were the 60's kings of wimp-rock only (British) Nirvana come close for thin wimped-out sounds (but Nirvana did record the glorious 'Tiny Godess' which is better than anything the Zombies ever cut!). Even the hooks on Time of the Season seems wafer thin. Rod Argent  used loads of diminished  / augmented chords etc and the songs seem superficially very well constructed. They had the theory down but in practice, the Zombies had no gift for melody (or lyrics) and could never land a killer punch. Even the excellent She's Not There seems to be based on Billy Fury's Wondrous Place. If you are hoping for a psychedelic masterpiece or high energy, atmospheric avant garde late-sixties sounds, listen before you buy!",0
"Only a review for the packaging!!!! i cannot believ the rubbish packaging of this product, a lock on the DVD case which requires a sharp obeject/scissor action, the disc stuck firmly inside the pocket...absolutely pointless, terrible, took me forever to get the friggin thing open.

There's nothing wrong with an artsy movie but this is very 'artsy movie' there are bits where there's dinosaurs, meteorites heading towards earth, scenes of natural disasters which are obviously symbolic..but utterly pointless, no doubt a scholar or tutor will pop in and interupt this review with delusional comparisons towards metaphors etc...but it's just pure bile!

He is the biggest brain kill of this no-brainer action flick.<br /><br />Great special effects though and awesome action. The plot isn't logical but it isn't incomprehensible.

"The Story of 'Oh...' Just finished the whole crazy, craven trilogy. All the repetition made me cry with laughter. How many times does Ana react with 'oh...'? Or 'Ah'? Or 'oh my'? And calling Christian 'Fifty' all the time as a nickname! Makes him sound like a middle-aged man. He certainly speaks like one, except for the token 'laters, baby.'<br /><br />Parents, beware. The blurb is very misleading - the reference to 'Ana and her Fifty Shades' makes CG sound like a supernatural ghostly character rather than a Mills and Boon hero who likes playing master and servant, flogging and harnessing Ana even when she's pregnant! The blurb and the spurious Twilight connection might make teenagers  pick it up, get all excited and start communicating online with real-life palm-twitchers calling themselves Mr Grey and asking for an 'Anastasia.'",0

addicting When I first downloaded this game I thought it would be one of those s***ty games but when my sister got the high score of 59 I decided to try and beat it after a few months I did so it is a very good app plus there is a hitler rants parody about it fantastic game,1
"Cool game It's good but it can be really annoying when you don't have the answer, it's a good game for little kids as well as my 6 year old little sister plays it and is on level 16",1

exellent This games awesome and so wonderful it is so good and fun it is a very good game to play when your very very very very bored,1
"Great guide with a few very minor issues. First of all the guide looks fantastic and is of high quality, the maps can be a little confusing in the chalice dungeons and they could have spell checked some stuff before release.<br /><br />Well worth the money in my eyes.",1

"housewife's pulp fiction Flat characters and dialogues, unframed phrasing.<br />When I begun enjoy a scene, that ended in such an irritating chlich&eacute; or dumb cursing.",0
"Not just for children I just recently read this book, at 21 as it came highly recommended by friends as a 'must read classic.'  I thought it was a fantastic tale of friendship and didn't have a predictable everyone lives happily ever after ending. <br /> <br />I have heard more positive things about this story from adults than children, and think it is a story truly to be passed through the ages as parents read this much loved story from their childhood to their own children. <br /> <br />It should not just be dismissed as a 'kids book' as all ages can enjoy and identify with it's themes.",0
bright! this pressing is a lot brighter sounding than you may be used to from this album.<br />buti guess its a personal taste thing<br />some copies also skip,0
great escape Enjoyed the game good for a novice gamer. Didn't find game to taxing for an older person or young one but may be to easy for others,1
"Tried & Tested Now don't get me wrong, I lurve Joe. Ever since I clapped my ears on Surfin' With The Alien, I have been astonished and captivated by Satrianis' sheer musical ability. Sublime, Fast, Awesome, Ridiculous, Funky, Sensitive, Rocktastic, Bombastic etc...<br /><br />Which leads me to JS's latest offering. Err, well it just sounds like his creative needle has got stuck on the last couple of albums. Nothing new on offer here. Move on. Yawn.<br /><br />I always felt that Satriani's real abilty was in his musical creativity and writing ability, which always pushed him above his peers (Vai et al). This now appears to have been watered down into mid-table obscurity. The King is dead, from the neck down. Sorry :¬(",0

"Does being different make it special? Looks good, promising idea, great reviews, but in the end this is just a plain story told approximately backwards. Typical of most modern films, method and gloss triumph over substance.    The moral behind this? If you have a severe memory defficiency, leave the detective work to others.    Not in the same league of the classics such as Jacob's Ladder or A Matter of Life and Death, not even close to Donnie Darko!",0

"Very poor product. I bought this expecting a high quality product since it has been mastered in 4K. Instead I got a very poorly packaged film that comes in a sheet thin case as opposed to the standard cases Blu-Rays are in despite showing a thick case in the thumbnail. The audio is very poor if you are wanting to watch this in English as it does not support DTS HD Master Audio in English only DTS which leaves for a much weaker surround sound experience although it says on the back it is encoded in DTS HD Master Audio. However, if you select German as the language it seems to support DTS HD perfectly but I do not understand German. It's too bad the only 4K Spider-Man 2 on Amazon is a German import meaning it strips the English options of the film of sound quality. Don't waste your time with this if you plan on watching this with a home theatre set up.",0
Five Stars Lovely,1
It didn't dawn on me until the end that I ... It didn't dawn on me until the end that I hadn't seen any men in the film...just shows we don't need em :),0
Very Average If the intros were not different you could almost think the entire album is one long track with some mechanical/tannoy voices thrown in. OMD set the popy loop going and that's pretty much it. There is little to be noted of accents and interest in the music and no soaring high points or thoughtful brooding passages.,0
"Purchased as a present A nice book, with some interesting photographs, but as this was purchased as a gift I did not read it, so cannot comment on the literary content. The book was rather larger than I was expecting, and as some previous reviews have noted there are some pages with a small photograph in the middle of a large page (lots of blank space around it). However, overall I am satisfied with my purchase.",0

"lacks the charm of his debut novel The Girl Who Saved The King Of Sweden is the second book by Swedish journalist, media consultant and television producer, Jonas Jonasson. Determined not to be a latrine emptier all her life, Soweto youngster, Nombeko Mayeki uses her numerical skills and lots of hard work to advance her position. How she learns to read, ends up in possession of quite a few diamonds and later, something a whole lot more dangerous, is the story Jonasson tells in the first half of his book. It takes that long before Nombeko arrives in Sweden and quite a bit longer before she gets anywhere near the King.<br /><br />Jonasson gives the reader the backstory of various major and minor characters in a series of anecdotes, some of which are quite funny. There is plenty of reference to both South African and Swedish politics (perhaps a little too much?), as well as a bit of world affairs, and generally, the plot is just as far-fetched as Jonasson’s first novel, The Hunded Year Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window And Disappeared, but this one lacks the charm of his debut novel. The title is a bit misleading as, in effect, the King saves himself. There are lots of chuckles but not as many laugh-out-loud moments, and while described as uproariously funny, readers may disagree. 3 stars.",0
Five Stars very well,1
It's ok Waited a long time for this book only to find myself disappointed with it Stephen king takes a long time to get started doesn't explain where the villains come from.  I was forcing myself to finish it.  Not a patch on the original or my favourite book of his Salems Lot,0

"Different After hearing about this classic piece of work on UFO God's and its theory, I was curiously inclined to check out the most referred to book on the topic. I certainly was intrigued and it offered fascinating thoughts on mysteries that we cant explain easily and comes up with a possible theory without being forceful. In fact it asks the questions and makes you ask the same questions without bombarding you with his theory as fact but as a indication of a possible explanation of the evidence. Sometimes mainstream historians and archaeologist explanations for some strange phenomena is weak and hard to accept. If you find this the case, then delve into the idea that maybe theres more to some of these mysteries than historians would have us believe.  EDIT: It turns out, many of the so called explanations are incorrect, and false, discredited. Scientifically and in various ways, the book has some parts well debunked. Its fun pseudo-history, but that's all it is really.",0

How I Met Your Mother Seasons 1-8 and Season 9 Arrived quickly with all 9 seasons. However season 1-8 came in a &#34;boxset&#34; and season 9 came as the DVD version you can buy by itself. Personally I would have preferred that all of the discs were in that one boxset.,1
"'Flat-line' performance Vocally,Hucknall will always give a good performance,but this particular re interpretation of a bunch of well known classics suffers rather from being too'samey', both in interpretation and selection.Am going to see him performing this album live on his tour next spring.Will be interesting to see if the performance has more 'oomph' than the album.<br />  My guess is that with it being a live gig there will be fsar more pzazz about the presentation (and almost certainly a leavening of other numbers to give it added variety)",0

Five Stars thanks. briliant,1
Extremely nice book. Life turning experience Extremely nice book. Life turning experience. I've attended one of the author's talk in person and he's such an inspirational person. Highly recommended.,1
"Brilliant start, awful ending The title says it all, really. The three stars are all for the first half of the book.<br /><br />The story builds up brilliantly to begin with - I couldn't put it down. The two narratives are compelling (as the cover blurb goes: 'there are two sides to every story' and, boy, do we get the two sides).<br /><br />The brilliance of the first part of the book is however completely let down by the ending. It deflates slowly like a sad, leftover party balloon. But what irritates me the most is that the completely unlikeable Nick, a simmering, seething misogynist who despises all women - his wife, the female police officer, a female journalist, a female neighbour, a female newsreader, a female call operator and even, in the end, his own sister - has his dinosaur views validated somewhat by Amy's behaviour. This is not a good outcome. Yes, Amy is manipulative, scheming, etc etc (I can't say more without spoiling the plot) but she is just one woman, whereas Nick's hatred is all-encompassing - you just have to have a vagina for this man to despise you ('they're all f*****g bitches, they're all psychos' - without exception).<br /><br />Hate to say it, but from a female author especially, I expected better.",0
"Good story A dark, scary ghost story set in a bleak landscape .  Not your House of Horror  but a good story line of great loss and revenge.",1
"Some very interesting psychological information is contained in this book ... Some very interesting psychological information is contained in this book, but I felt it did not have enough structure.<br /><br />Also, the easy-to-remember acronym they use to help apply the techniques is so contrived that I would rather they didn't have one.<br /><br />However, my biggest gripe is that there are some wholly inaccurate examples used, particularly the one about engineers and machinists. I am afraid it just shows the difference between academics and those of us that have to make a living in the real world.",0
Five Stars Love it!,1
"This is a Brilliant app. I love  it, it's challenging and fantastic way to stop you being bored. Also, it is really fun to just mess around on and compete with friends :-)",1
"Better Than Expected This book probably isn't something I would usually pick up in a book shop. I was actually bought Paper Towns as a Christmas present. I think it's safe to assume that my friend knows my taste in books better than I do, because I loved this book.<br /><br />This is the first novel by John Green that I have read. I hadn't really heard of him before Goodreads, but the consistently high ratings prompted me to turn the first page of Paper Towns just a few days after unwrapping it. And I'm glad I did. This book is unlike anything else I've read before - it has a real, deep meaning, a meaning that is extremely relevant to society today. I didn't expect this before reading. Nor did I expect the humour that enfolded (particularly regarding Ben and his need to urinate in part three - need I say more?).<br /><br />The only downside is that the pace slowed down in the second part of the book, hence the reason why I didn't read it quicker. I realise that writing a page-turner from start to finish is very difficult, however, and probably wasn't the aim of this book, anyway. The humour, emotion, surprise and suspense of part three made up for this entirely, though.<br /><br />I picked up two more Green books a few days ago, after getting completely absorbed in this one. Yes, I'll admit it: I'm his newest fan.",1
20% cooler than any other game I AM A BRONY AND I LOVE THIS! CAN`T WAIT TO GET APPLE JACK FOR THIS GAME. SEE U LATERS!,1

"Not the amazing album we were expecting! Now like all fans of The Prodigy I was waiting with immense anticipation on the release of this album, because all good things comes to those who wait, right?!? Wrong! This album by The Prodigy falls somewhat very short in what made them the pioneers and trend setters in the genre of dance music in previous albums such as Fat of the land, Gilted Generation etc! Other than the first track The Day Is My Enemy this album really doesn't present anything else new or refreshing! The rest of the other songs sound like regurgitated material from past tracks. There are slight moments of groundbreaking beats but they merely last but seconds before the melodies return back to the norm. It does seem that Liam & Co when writing/producing this album have been away for Six years to long and have lost/forgotten on what made them brilliant in the past?!? Such a shame really as I'm a massive fan of The Prodigy and their music always makes me feel uplifted! But this album, makes you feel somewhat flat and is just all to familiar!!!!",0
Five Stars Had fun with this app very cleverly done .,1
"Hours of fun,  worth the money A great game which can entertain for hours. The levels are endless if you consider the multiple difficulties.<br />The only problems I personally had were the battery that the game consumes and how hot it can make your phone.<br />These were only minor problems though,  other than this, the game is brilliant.",1
Milking it for all it's worth... I could believe the author when she said this was all for the fans if she had kept it to one book only. But milking this to yet another three books it's clearly for another couple of zero's on her bankaccount. A shame really that there always will be a lot of readers who are going to buy book two and three. Glad to say that I will not be one of them...,0

"entertaining enough though i did enjoy this dramatic action thriller,i thought it was missing something.there was drama,to be sure,and plenty of action.but it was not as thrilling as i had hoped or expected.there was enough tension to keep me watching,but none of the 'edge of your seat 'or nerve shredding intensity.it wasn't boring,by any means but compared to the tension in Crimson Tide,for instance(also directed by Tony Scott)there was no comparison.Scott really reigned himself in here(which he usually has trouble doing(see Domino)but in this case,he could have let loose a bit.still,the movie was entertaining enough.for me,Unstoppable is a 3/5",0
"Not sure what the fuss is about!? Although well written, this book is not what it claims to be, it certainly does not live up to the hype! I thought this was very disappointing. All the way through there was a hope it would get better, but it doesn't and the ending is the biggest disappointment at all, not closure for the story.",0

"Give it a miss... Unless you're a diehard Rice fan, a disposition to which I plead guilty, give this title a miss - for a book about half the length of the last 3 in the chronicles it sure drags on...she's too concerned with exploring theological territory and for someone who has done religious studies I felt I was reading one of my text books - she's tried to describe the story of creation, angels, God, the devil and failed really in the sense that throughout the last four books you fall so in love with the characters that even though you know its fiction, it becomes eerie and believable to you, a world that exists alongside your own - this book was a definite dissapointment but it won't stop me from reading the next and the next...but I wish i'd been able to put this down...really put it down...listened to myself and just stopped reading and not wasted the time.",0
Five Stars Glad to have it in my collection.,1
Five Stars Totally happy with the product,1
I GIVE THIS A ONE STAR RATING WHINEY AND MOANY AT TIMES SOME RECORD SEEM TO GO ON FOREVER AND THE CONTEXT OF THE MUSIC IS SCRIPTED AS SUCH THAT THE SOUND IS LESS MOODY AND MELLOW THAN ONE CAN IMAGINE.

The third instalment of the 'Alien' films.Sigourney Weaver's character,'Ripley' now finds herself,on a penal colony,with the deadly alien she's unwittingly brought along with her.The mood of the film's quite sombre,obviously set in a prison! The best part I thought,was where Ripley,and the inmates hatch the plan to kill the alien,as it starts to bump them all off,one by one! It's not bad,but all the other 3 Alien films,were done much better.",0

"Some classic hits here, remembered I can remember seeing Blondie on Top Of The Pops as and 8 to 10 year old in the late 70's recall quite liking them but not knowing particularly why. \\""""Heart Of Glass\\"""", \\""""The Tide Is High\\"""" and \\""""Denis\\"""" are the ones I recall. This CD reminds of those old Top Of The Pops shows.<br /><br />I nevery actually bought any Blondie records. By the time I was buying records for myself they had disappeared and I pretty much forgot about them. Lisening to this CD I clearly appreciate their place at the top of UK band list for their period.<br /><br />I would make a note of \\""""One Way Or Another\\"""", which I think has a fantastic chorus.<br /><br />Sometimes I can't quite make out all the lyrics in the verses on some of the pacier songs.<br />I've noted that some reviewers complaining about the re-mastering. Now, I'm not familiar enough with the original releases to comment, but I would say listening to the album copied onto MP3 player / USB stick for the car, there are points were the sound does sound a bit uneven, especially on \\""""Atomic\\"""".<br /><br />On the whole I certainly like this collection if I don't particularly love it. It falls in the category of albums I would play for a change.",0
"not as scary as i thought it would be i`ve seen the first film and was looking forward to this, bit i admit to feeling let down a bit, yes ok there was a certain amount of tension and when the spooky action was on screen it was good , but it just did`nt do the scary thing for me, maybe i just expect to much or i am to easily  fooled by the hype ( read skyline review) but sorry to say like the first film all the shock value of this is in the last couple of minutes,  still fairly good fun while eating a chicken kebab and a couple of beers on a sat night 5/10",0

"Good and bad aspects Brilliant recreation of the Holy land in the 12th century and of the castle siege yet the atmosphere and the characters were a bit too light and jolly for such a period(american audience oblige). Medieval world was a little more obscure and brutal. The cast is grand except for Bloom who has no charisma whatsoever and sadly takes away the magic throughout the whole film(stick to romantic comedies mate, you're not much of a knight).",0

"Much Ado About Nothing Since reading The Da Vinci Code, I've been quite a fan of Dan Brown's output, including Angels & Demons, Digital Fortress etc.    However, although the book starts well, and the pace hots up...at the end The Lost Symbol just gets, well... lost. It's about the supposed power and influence of Masons and desperately attempts to imbue various American buildings with deep historic and spiritual significance. Like the Da Vinci Code, there's plenty of mysterious and labyrinthine plot developments and it is initially a real page turner, but the ending is an incredible anti-climax once the villain is killed. Dan Brown then seems to claim that The Bible, The Koran and The Tora etc have deep scientific significance and that Isaac Newton himself believed this to be the case. Personally I find this hard to believe, but the real problem is that in this last part where it gets into religion it's just incredibly boring. Instead of ending with a bang, the books ends with a whimper.    In conclusion, I felt totally cheated. I felt I'd wasted my money and worse still, like when one watches a bad film, I had wasted many hours of life I will never get back!",0

"I decided in a few seconds this book is crappy psychobabble It's not clear whether this book has anything in it that could be called a 'theory'.<br /><br />Gladwell (if he wrote it - there's so much race awareness that I can't help wondering if the book was ghosted for a professional half-caste) has two characteristics, typical of the market aimed for: [1] They must have no knowledge outside any conventional establishment beliefs, [2] They must be swayed by emotions - violence, typically, though softer emotions peep in as well.<br /><br />Some of Gladwell's examples are taken (I'd guess from popular books) from such worlds as art appreciation, wars, police activity, market research into drinks, and formal music.  In each case the 'American' view is assumed without thinking (even momentarily).  A few examples: Tom Hanks has appeared in essentially misleading films on e.g. AIDS, Vietnam war, Second World War, NASA - but Gladwell knows nothing of this, and quotes some real or imaginary casting person talking about Hanks's supposed wonderful screen image.  There's an account of a cheap brandy, packaged in a boring way, losing ground to another brandy, packaged attractively.  There's something similar about 'colas' - the amazing insight that one sip of a drink may have a different effect from a whole bottle.  A 'veteran' of Vietnam is discussed (there is a painfully long digression on military matters) with no discussion of the rather overwhelming superiority of firepower.<br /><br />The examples Gladwell gives of accurate spli-second decisions generally need huge amounts of preliminary work - e.g. whether a classical trombone player is good, whether an artwork is a fake, how to sell cars, whether a facial expression exists - two men (who appeal to Derren Brown) get quite long mentions, but their decisions are only possible because videos of facial expressions now exist.  All of this material is what might resonably be called 'learning'.  Some material, for example the effect of facial expressions on emotions (in addition to the other way round - something claimed by William James) or of words of a certain tone on peoples' behaviour (New Yorkers becoming polite because of reading scrambles sentences with polite words in) doesn't seem to connect with the general idea of the book.<br /><br />One star.

Pretty good I played this on the Xbox and it was one of my favourite games. When I saw it on on the app store I was so happy that I can play it on the go. However one drawback is that I cannot join games that are on IOS and android because of the update differences. I would rate five star if it is updated at the same time.,1
Five Stars Yite been very good and,1
Four Stars my son said it was good,1

"Bitterly Disappointed His first album was one of the most enjoyable I'd heard for many years. There were no songs I disliked - which is almost unheard of - and some absolutely stunning ones, including \\""""Simple as This\\"""" which would be one of my \\""""Desert Island Discs\\"""". So, like virtually everyone else who bought it, I was looking forward enormously to the second album and purchased it before listening to it. True, the reviews weren't brilliant and, true, the songs I'd heard (like Slumville Sunrise) hadn't impressed me but I really thought that I wasn't going to be disappointed with his second album.<br /><br />However, after I'd played it, I felt a sense of abject disappointment. There wasn't a single song that grabbed me or held my attention; indeed, I wasn't even sure that I even wanted to listen to any of it again (and I can normally tell whether I like a song on first hearing). Nevertheless, although I persisted and have now listened to it at least a dozen times, I still feel a sense of disappointment. I only really like two songs (neither of which is anywhere near as good as the best on the first album) and find three more merely \\""""OK\\""""; sadly, I have no particular desire to hear the remainder again. I'll no doubt try again, but, if I don't like them after twelve hearings, it's unlikely they're ever going to appeal.<br /><br />So, what's wrong with the album? Mainly, there's an absence of the wonderful melodies that were on the first album. When I reviewed that on Amazon last year, I said that he was the most outstanding talent I'd heard for many, many years with songs on a par with those of the Beatles, Kinks, Stones and Bee Gees. Maybe I'll still think that after album number three - but I don't think that now. I found a number of songs overstayed their welcome, with uninteresting and unnecessary instrumental fills in the middle, and utterly mediocre drumming and bass guitar work throughout. I don't think he's ever been well-served by his choice of drummer, but the bass guitar work on the previous album added enormously  to it. I also found intensely grating his frequent pronunciation of \\""""th\\"""" as \\""""v\\"""" - \\""""with\\"""" becomes \\""""wiv\\"""", for example. I can live with it with it in everyday speech but there's no need for it in song: it simply sounds slovenly and, given that it doesn't happen on every song, it's quite unnecessary.<br /><br />As I submit this review (which, in any case, is only a subjective opinion), I realise that I'm so far in a minority of one and that I could well get a lot of flak , of which that from the trolls which abound on this website will no doubt be quite abusive.<br /><br />I'll continue to follow his career with interest and look forward to hearing album no 3. I'm pleased that so many people are thoroughly enjoying Shangri La; I really wish I was one of them<br /><br />Incidentally, on YouTube there is a song of his called \\""""The one I never knew\\"""" which has had over 96,000 hits. It's a pity that didn't make it onto the album.",0

"Ordinary I can only echo Bob Salter's comments that this film is hugely disappointing , and am quite frankly baffled by the five star reviews.<br />Actually \\""""ordinary\\"""" is being over generous- it is just very very dull.",0
"Not sure I get the hype Honestly? Meh. What's all the fuss about?<br /><br />Kid in peril. Kid flees. Kid acquires magical abilities. Kid defeats bad guys. Anyone read Stephen King's \\""""Talisman\\""""?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film was pretty, reasonably well scripted - it was too long by about 50%, but I can let that go.<br />But seriously what is the fuss about?",0
"The Secret to Making a Quick Buck I'm sure this book only exists thanks to The Da Vinci Code. Sensing a public interest in ancient \\""""secrets\\"""" passed down to modern times, the publishers of this awful piece of self-help decided they could market Rhonda Byrne's book and make a killing. They were not wrong. In Brasil, it's spreading like an Old World plague: the film tie-in is always rented out in videostores, and the book is in the top 10 bestseller list. Swept up by its popularity, my mom brought a copy home.<br /><br />Much like George Bush Jr., this book is equal parts stupid and disturbing. The stupid part comes in its mind-boggling belief that anything you ask from the Universe will become true, that everyone deserves (and should) pursue their most selfish desires in order to be happy. Want big boobs? Ask the Universe and you will get it. Want a great parking space at the shopping mall? The Universe will help you like a genie in a bottle. Knowledge found in Eastern religions such as Buddhism (e.g. Karma) are simplified and described as a \\""""secret\\"""" that only the elite are aware of.<br /><br />The disturbing part comes in statements such as the one, early in the book, that says people killed in disasters or crimes brought it upon themselves. According to this book's reasoning, if you find yourself gassed to death with millions of other people it's because you were following negative thoughts and unable to see the Universe's path to your salvation. This is, at least, the conclusion I draw from the book's teachings. It shifts blame from other people, or life's chaos, onto yourself. Contracted cancer? Your fault. Robbed and shot in the head? Your fault. Became a millionaire? You are in tune with the Universe.<br /><br />Much like The Da Vinci Code I couldn't make it past page 60. Be very wary of anyone that likes this book.",0
"Okay. Still not sure how to play this game! Was no clear instruction about &amp;#34;farmers&amp;#34; so now I just fire them down at random! Then usually lose at the end. I heard it was based on a board game so may be we are expected to know how to play. We all have it after all, right? Got it free so can't complain really . I could probably watch a YouTube video to understand how to play, but thats just stupid when I have the app on my phone!?! Right?!?",0

"Great Film I saw this with my college class at the Showcase Deluxe Cinema in Bristol. I'm not massive into Formula 1. However this kept me gripped and lost in the storyline throuhgout. IT WAS AMAZING. I was blown away with the techincality of it, the camera angles and the sound design really bring out all that is amazing about this film.<br /><br />The stiry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt, their friendship and competition to win the Grand Prix, and of course Niki;s crash. THE CRASH SCENE. It's exactly the same as the real crash they looked at the whole film and I felt like I was there in the action side by side. GLUED THROUGHOUT<br /><br />AMAZING FILM<br /><br />5 Stars!!!<br /><br />Great present for my Dad he will love this.",1
"disappointing Fails to capture the intense feeling of fear and paranoia that is present in carpenters masterpiece from 1982. The special effects are bad  and the actors are not by any means in the same league as kurt Russel, Richard Dysart and Wilford Brimley. As for the script there is a certain feeling of deja vu, as some of the scenes seem remarkably similar to scenes from carpenters film. This film will just kill time on a boring day, which is about the best thing you can say about it.",0
Five Stars Good delivery time and a very good Marshall arts film.,1
"Repeat of previous issue. This book is a unworthy of the series. The Amazon site suggested it was a new issue with effect from 27th March 2014.<br />In fact it is exactly the same as a previous issue ( although the cover looks different ) published way back in 2001.<br />The only reason this came to light is that my wife has a full set of \\"""" Game of thrones \\"""" and on reading her new present<br />she identified the plot -- what a disappointment - not to mention sharp practice.<br />UPDATE<br />Got in touch with Amazon who immediately credited me in full.

The story was great and the character of Christian Grey unforgettable. I do think this book is a disappointment as it regurgitated far too much of the original.

excellent film! I was a bit unsure whether or not to buy this film but I am really glad that I did! It is a beautiful yet hilarious film and I really enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a typical 'love Film'. The time travelling parts captivated me. Definitely worth a watch!,1

Not quite... ... what I expected after reading the reviews and looking inside. Have spent a few hours going through the book but the test will come when I use it to undertake some more complicated mountain bike maintenance. I may yet return to update this review after that.,0
Sorry Katy Good singing voice & some catchy tunes but the CD won't be played as often as it might. Poor lyrics & some tunes let down the product. Maybe it would be better for a younger market regardless of the 'parental' warning. Cut out the swearing & then she will have reached her target audience. For me I would prefer her voice put to far greater use - shame on her song writers.,0
Great Songs Great selection of backstreet boys songs.  Bought for child and is well loved.  Has been played numerous times.  Good to see the young ones love them.  Been well worth it!,1
"PERFECT! I bought Beatrix Potter 'The Complete Tales' as a Christening gift. I wanted something different and after reading the wonderful reviews and decided to purchase the book myself.<br /><br />It arrived only 2 days after ordering, I think it was,  and well packaged.  So I was happy.  However, when I opened the book  I couldn't take the smile off my face.  It's beautiful.  I've haven't read any of Beatrix Potter's stories....I was an Enid Blyton fan when I was a young child.  However, I am going to buy this book for myself....and I am nearly 51 years old now!!<br /><br />The pages look like the original pages would (cream in colour  on quality paper with all the original illustrations, rather than blindingly white cheap print paperstock with modern illustrations).  It is a perfect book to have or to give as a gift.  It is a book that you could hand down to your children quite easily, I think.  The 'sleeve' keeps the beautiful book clean and protected.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book for children and adults alike.",1
not happy Would not rescind this as soon as you reach level 100 when you try to access it again just says coin dozed has stopped with ok appearing below this message. So not a happy crappie.good job it was free.I feel for those people purchased extra cions,0
"Anti-German paranoia and bluster with ridiculous plot Most people like the things they were brought up with: jazz, swing, Sinatra, the Beatles, for example, affect people young at the time; but have less effect on others.  The Thirty-Nine Steps is regarded by some as a 'classic'.  Does it have an appeal other than sentiment?<br /><br />THE BOOK<br />Buchan was a Scot who'd spent time in southern Africa.  As far as I can find out, he wrote this short book after the First World War had been started in 1914.  It's assumed that Britain and France are allies, and Germany and Russia possible victims.  The USA was not part of the war, then.  Remarkably, Buchan includes a conspiracy theory about international capital and Jews: a small portion of Buchan is sometimes quoted on this topic, misleadingly, because the speaker, Scutter (a 'fine linguist'), who buttonholed Hannay, reveals something different in his coded notes later.  It's not clear what, but Buchan avoids this conspiracy issue.<br /><br />The plot depends on several strands, in addition to Scutter's notebook fortuitously falling into the hero's hands.  One is the German boat off the coast; the plot is based on a small English port and its tides.  This seems outdated by aeroplanes, but never mind.  Another element is the secret which has to be moved overseas.  Here, it isn't a microfilm etc, but coded reports put together outlining a likely war plot.  A third is baddies who have almost magical powers, something amplified later in Ian Fleming's stories.  We have three Germans, one of them an actor (with a fingertip missing) so convincing he can impersonate a high-ranking government official known personally to the rest of a cabinet-level group.  This is only even remotely credible given the lack of television and newspaper photographs at that time.  A fourth is Hannay happening purely by chance on a house lived in by the aforesaid baddie in a remote part of Scotland!  Obviously, any absurd plot needs supporting props - the police must be incompetent, for instance.  So must the baddies - in the book, Hannay is locked up in a room where there are explosives, which enable him to blast his way out.<br /><br />HITCHCOCK'S FILM, 'THE 39 STEPS'<br />Let's see if we can retrace what may have been Hitchcock's mental processes when given the contract for this film is 1934 or thereabouts.<br /><br />** Much of the plot is unfilmable; the German acting material has to go.  The Hannay as master of disguises, rather as described by Baden-Powell in Africa, has to go.  The chance Scottish location has to go - Hannay must be told where it is.  The outdoor location by the sea has to go, which means 39 Steps becomes a collection of people, and not a place.<br /><br />** There are filmic requirements: this was all filmed on British Acoustic Film at Shepherd's Bush.  Variety means slightly odd effects: close ups, strange angles, and a general collage of detail, intended to hide the lack of expansive, general overviews.  The ceilings are non-existent - a lot of lighting was needed up there.  There are quite a lot of notices, maybe a relic of the text boxes in silent films:  THE FLYING SCOTSMAN and blocks of flats, place names, inns, things in lights.<br /><br />** Must have music.  A weird convention required strings where Madeleine Carroll realised Robert Donat had being telling the truth all along.  And there are music halls and the Hippodrome.  Even the political speech, from the book, has applause and a theatrical ambience.<br /><br />** Now we need some sex.  Hitchcock adds three main women: Scutter is replaced by a female 'agent' who invites herself back to stay with him.  And there's a wife of a Scottish crofter, more appealing than the original single roadmender chap, who likes Hannay.  There's Madeleine Carroll, in the romantic fiction role - dislikes him, then finds he's wonderful.  She has a scene where she removes her stockings, which the censors must have reviewed a number of times.  And, well, a few others.<br /><br />** ... And we needsubsidiary characters.  Ian Hay wrote the script: pub quiz style questions and catcalls, men travelling in women's clothing, Scottish dialogue, middle classes and servants.  None of this is in Buchan.<br /><br />** Finally, the plot has to weave the loose ends into some material semblance.  'Mr Memory' thing works well enough - he could mention a secret and a foreign power, but be shot before it was named,  and one hopes most of the audience wouldn't notice that Mr Memory's words could have been jotted down beforehand.  The device provides an assembly point for the cast; and it gave plenty of scope for action with music, and the public and policemen rushing about.<br /><br />I think, to be honest, it's just another type of propaganda.ons and catcalls, men travelling in women's clothing, Scottish dialogue, middle classes and servants.

"Bloated and disappointing Another reviewer says this album never really takes off, I thought that's ok, some artists are just restrained and that's their style. However, I've been patient with this album but listening to it leaves me with the impression that this group just simply don't let themselves go. They need some spark to their music, and, if not, if not some kind of groove, the band just seem to take themselves far too seriously to allow such frivolities and we're left with something soulless and pedestrian. They should get drunk or high or something  and get into the studio with a different producer and let loose a bit, they might surprise themselves. This is a bloated and over-produced album with tracks that go on for too long - like someone who has nothing interesting to say, but likes the sound of their own voice.<br />I've given it 2 stars because two tracks hint at the possibility that should they pull their heads out of their respective derrieres they could put together something worthwhile.",0

"Historic Hoodwinking I first heard this at the close of 1969. It was played to me by a fellow enthusiast who informed me that this was likely to take me surprise, as it did him. I was then & remain a huge admirer of 'Safe As Milk' & liked 'Strictly Personal' mainly for the astonishing Gimme Dat Harp Boy (on which the Cap'n booglarizes Howlin' Wolf) & I adore at least four of the later records, but this .....my friend was right- 'Trout Mask Replica' certainly did take my surprise & after about three tracks I was pleading with him to turn it off. Was the whole double album like this? Pretty much so ..... great isn't it, huh? Well no, not exactly. Perhaps I wasn't in the most receptive mood & promised myself that I'd give it some attention a little later, but my first impression was not at all favourable. And ever since then I've given this album an airing at least once year & I still don't get it. It always, without fail, hits my ears as an unlikeable incoherent mess. I've taken on board the paradox of a set of forms without consistent form & all the theoretical stuff, but it still doesn't work for me at all. I've listened to the album's champions tell me I'm missing the point but no-one has actually succeeded in clueing me up on what the point of it really is. Does it defy description? Perhaps. But that doesn't make it likeable. And now, all these years later, I'm inclined to regard it as the most over-rated album of all time. It sounds like a man in the throes of a chemically-induced nervous breakdown & at the end of the day, for me, that's the point of 'Trout Mask Replica'. Some think it a masterpiece while so many others find it virtually unlistenable. I guess it's a matter of taste, after all, & no Beefheart album has appealed less to mine than this one.",0
Five Stars The title says it all.,1
"A missed opportunity First of all, I love the books. I love the story, the writing, the characters, the world that's created and the gritty, grimy atmosphere. Having read a lot of good things about this series I pre-ordered this set hoping for an epic dark tale of greed, power, lust and deception, not as big and all-encompassing as the books of course, no television or even movie budget would allow for that given the scope of the world and the story, but still something at least as gritty as, for example, Rome or Deadwood, something that looked somehow natural and real, within the confines of a tv-series.<br />What I got was a cast of mixed quality actors (some great, some truly awful, most in somewhere in between, perfectly serviceable given the right directions, some with great potential, like the girl who plays Arya, easily the most natural and convincing performance of the series) against overly lit cardboard backgrounds delivering badly timed dialogue from key scenes from the books in static soap opera frames. I don't want to into too much detail, but generally it's all too small, too bright and most importantly far too clean, some random genitals and entrails notwithstanding. Dimming the lights and throwing some buckets of muck around would have made a big difference without having to stretch the budget. Using some digital grading and experimenting with grain and depth of field would have given it a more movie-like quality which is now missing completely. Sometimes it reminded me of 80's BBC period drama in all its cleanliness and emptiness, almost making it look like a play. Examples? The tourney scene must be the saddest piece of amateur period recreation I have ever witnessed. It's supposed to be a great championship with no expenses spared, a massive gathering of the finest swords in the very epicentre of the 7 kingdoms, a dazzling display of wealth and power. Look at it somewhat closely and tell me what you see. Clearly the 50 or so extras dotted around the empty set, symbolizing the great masses drawn to the joust of the century, have no idea what is expected of them. There is no tension, no atmosphere whatsoever, and it's all over in 2 minutes or so. The scenes with the Dothraki fare even worse. These savage, fierce and proud horse people from the east, who travel in packs of many thousands, raping the land and terrorizing its people like a plague of locusts as they go, are brought to life (?) resembling something approaching a guided tour for elderly herbologists as they amble gently through the scene. At one point I was expecting David Attenborough or Desmond Morris casually sliding into view (\\""""...The Dothraki are a simple people, co-existing with nature in their own unique way...\\"""").  At first I was willing to overlook these and many other predictable shortcomings (don't even get me started about the dogs), as it's `only' a television series, but in the end it all became too much and I just couldn't stomach it anymore. I stopped watching after episode 7 out of fear of partly ruining my appreciation of these great books.  To me, the problems are caused by shoddy directing (empty lifeless scenes, poor direction of actors and extras) and inappropriate camera work (too sharp, too static, too bright). It just doesn't flow to me. I don't even dare to imagine what they will do to the second book, when the madness really gets going.<br />I know this is only one man's opinion and that the great majority of viewers experienced this series differently, but to me it's just not good enough to warrant all this fanfare. I really wish it were otherwise.<br />In the meantime:  Please, please, please (re) read the books. They are really worth the time and money. This, sadly, is not.",0

"Funny.. But not funny enough This book is alright, it has its (few) funny moments in the typical style of The Oatmeal, but not enough for the book to be memorable afterwards. Whereas The Oatmeal's first book \\""""5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth\\"""" is full of twisted yet funny angles that makes you want to read it over and over again, \\""""How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\\"""" does not live up to its predecessor and is easily forgotten because of the lack of variety. The theme of the book is obviously \\""""cats\\"""" but I do not feel that The Oatmeal has used the potential of the theme fully. All in all, it is a nice book, that fans of The Oatmeal shouldn't miss. However, if you don't know who The Oatmeal is, or what his humour is like, then you probably shouldn't buy the book.",0
"An appalingly bad book I have read all of the books in this series, and have to say they offended my intelligence like no other. The premise of Mr Kiyosaki having a rich dad and a poor dad is based on complete lies - He simply had the one dad, and the other was made up - He has said as much in interviews. He has no place to be giving advice to anyone. The fortune that he claims to have has been made from selling books like this, not from any system that he puts forward in his books. This book contains many factual errors - too numerous to mention. One basic oversimplified example is that he claims that only corporations can pay business expenses before paying tax, while the opposite is true. I suggest that anyone planning on buying Robert Kiyosaki's books save their money, or buy something else. Each book is the same oversimplified messages regurgitated",0

"Perfect As others have noted, I love how this book have so many pictures, which I can make my own notes on. The spiral bound hard copy is a very good form. I use this book in conjuction with Ashtanga Philosophy & Practice by George Maehle as I feel they complement each other very well. The other one has more in depth discussion and explanation on all the basic pranayama, anatomy of poses, but this one is more compact and perfect for me to take note on the pictures as my 'cheat' guide & checklist for each pose.",1
Five Stars Perfect,1
"Astounded at the number of good reviews The characters are very 1 dimensional (clichéd Jewish mother/ submissive young lover), and the dialogue between all of them is even worse (&#34;You're totally crazy, Goldman. That's what I like about you&#34;/ &#34;I'm not going to leave this town until I understood what happened 33 years ago&#34;). It may be the translation from French, but I just couldn't hear anyone saying the many lines that seem more like a joke. It was also very hard to get invested or care for the characters – the main character is an egotistical writer. Overall, it just seems to be badly written literature. Go for Donna Tartt's 'The Secret History' instead.",0

I had my legs crossed the whole way through reading this book because its that good haha .. the second book gets even steamier!! defo invest in this you wont be disappointed!!!,1
Not captivating until the end o fthe book When I read the back of this book I thought it would be great. Its a brilliant idea however I think that the storyline could have been better executed. There was far too much time spent in Bologna and the streets of Italy with the main character visiting all the cafes with his handler that I found frankly tedious.    A good hint to anyone who wants to read this book is that it really takes off from the final third of the book- The Great Escape! However for a Grisham novel I have high expectations and I was disappointed overall with the book.,0

"Not that great I thought it was a bit slow for starts and the storyline didn't really hold me. The last few pages were quite intense. I like the way it the story was told from the innocent eyes of Bruno but I thought he was a bit too naive for a nine year old. It was a sad story but John Boyne wrote it in a great way to show the serious affects of the war through innocent eyes. Overall, I thought it was a good read but the storyline could have been a bit more exciting and not a book that I'd read again.",0

Bruce's last few albums have been sparklers and have reflected his anger well,so will this follow suit?  The initial feeling is perhaps that the album was slightly rushed,but don't despair,the thought of Bruce making a bad album is about as likely as Timmy Mallet interviewing Osama bin laden  in the nude in Lewisham High Street.  Throughout the album Bruce wears his influences on his sleeve most notably Dylan and to a lesser extent in the lyrical sense McCartney,the lyrics are not quite as good as we  have come to expect,but still  this is only a slight fault  I have yet to watch the DVD,but the CD/DVD Packaging is well up to standard.",0

"Pointless Like many other fans, I was also fooled by the advertisement and thought the DVD would have a 5.1 mix, only to be deeply disappointed upon unpacking and listening to the material. But apart from that major drawback, the other CDs really do not add anything if you already have the 2008 double set (except maybe the different version of Karn part 3). the original CD advertised as remastered, is probably a flat transfer, mixed way too low. After reading the comments on the super deluxe box set which I can't afford, I reassure myself that I probably didn't miss much as I read the 5.1 mix is not that good after all, also I already have the DVD documentary on the &#34;From The Beginning&#34; box set. I'm therefore sticking with my 2008 double CD set and my 2001 Rhino 5.1 mix, which still sounds fantastic to my ears. Looking forward to the Trilogy re-release though!

"All smoke and mirrors Ever get the impression the author is winging it? Not entirely sure where it's all going? Welcome to the Night Circus. What probably should have been a neat little short story is spun out over 500 pages - and boy does it feel contrived. What the author has failed to do is come up with a convincing 'why?'. There is simply no plausible motivation for the Night Circus - apart from some vague idea that two opposing practitioners of 'real' magic want to pit their different teaching methods against the other, over and over again. Why they want to do this is anyone's guess - boredom? Who knows? And so the Night Circus stumbles along in search of a raison d'etre that never materialises. There are weird, pointless subplots. What's the point of the clock maker and his band of circus devotees? What's the point of Bailey? The author is desperately trying to make sense of her own creation, which is a shame, because she can write, beautifully at times. Although there are probably one too many kittens for my liking.",0
"Wasted opportunity I cannot remember a film I have had a higher anticipation for in the last few years. I am a huge Burton fan despite a rather wobbly few years. I refuse to say my expectations were too high, because this film didnt even come close. For me, this was a wasted opportunity. I would have loved to see the original Alice in Wonderland tale remade with the Burton magic, but thats not what we got. Instead we got somewhat of a sequel, a story that frankly has no spark about it whatsoever and I even fail to recall it having just watched it. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter is given far too big a role to live upto and therefore feels like no more than a vehicle for Depp's CV. His peformace just didnt work for me. This film did look great however! And it was great to see such a collection of British and American talent together. I never thought id say this, but a REMAKE would have been better.",0
"Fascinating stories - unconvincing conclusions The book starts with a fascinating collection of stories about historical societies that have collapsed due to ecological disasters. These stories are very fascinating and include stories such as: Easter Island, The Norse in Greenland and the collapse of the Maya civilisation.    Later in the book Diamond moves on to describe moderns problems and this is where the book gets confusing. He has chapters about mining waste in Montana and erosion of soil in Australia. The country of Australia is not likely to collapse due to soil erosion (And Diamond admits that), so why did he put a chapter about Australia in his book about collapsing societies?    Summing up there are a lot of good stories in the book, and it does make a lasting impression, but the editor should have forced Diamond to remove those chapters that are not relevant to his central point. That could have made the book more trustworthy and clearcut.",0

"If you're looking for old school Jamiroquai, you won't much of it here. I've Been a huge fan of this band for several years.  My first experience of them was Virtual Insanity back in the mid 90s.  Then I heard Canned Heat, and decided to buy the rest of the discography.  All the albums that have come out up to this point have been really good (yes, I liked \\""""Dynamite\\"""" too).  \\""""Emergency On Planet Earth\\"""" is my favorite.    When I read that they were going to a more \\""""organic\\"""" sound, wishful thinking made me believe the band's next release would contain mostly songs with an acid-jazz style like the early days.    That was a mistake.    I should have known that just from the way the album cover looks.    \\""""She's A Fast Persuader\\"""" is the one song that hooked me.  I even made it the ringtone on my phone.  I knew I'd love it from just hearing the first few keyboard chords of the song.    I kinda like \\""""White Knuckle Ride,\\"""" and the title track, \\""""Rock Dust Light Star,\\"""" but the majority of the album doesn't have the sound I care for.    The annoying thing is this is a band that I absolutely love, and I really want to like this CD, so I keep playing it hoping more of the tracks will grow on me.    \\""""All Good In The Hood\\"""" is growing on me.  I like the drum beat, and Paul's bass playing during the chorus.    \\""""Smoke and Mirrors\\"""" is also a song I've found myself thinking about as I walk.    The rest of the tracklist hasn't gotten me going like the rest of the discography.    To sum it up:  1. I love 1 song.  2. I kinda like 2 songs.  3. 2 songs are growing on me.    I don't normally expect to like more than 2 songs on any CD I purchase.  But this is Jamiroquai, a band that at the very least has had 3 songs on each CD that were 'must-plays.'    This album doesn't have more than one song like that.  I'm disappointed, but at the same time I hope that enough people will buy this to make it worth Jay's while to give it another go.",0

"disapointed!!!! As a lover of jane austen, i was so disapointed with this addaption following the review's that it had recieved. I am no critic and i am sure there are many things that the film did well, but i could not get my head around the partnership between the two main cast members. The age difference made the leading lady, appears to be more like his daughter than suiter, nor was the passion, longing or desire believable between the pair. As an old romantic this was disapointing and was lost watching the film with the story line, not one of the stronger stories and not worth watching again?",0

who's idea was the coins on the new update? We're do I start...  a AWESOME GAME well was. I used to AWESOME at it by getting lots of money levelling up then THE UPDATE CAME I was level 13 then I only got 15 coins REALLY! I would have got about 600 coins then it was like one big sign saying ULTIMATE FAIL. And it's not a dating site like really if u go on the list of servers about half are for dating. Really . And also android and I o s users are all hacking while it's impossible to hack on the kindle so they will be like 5 people on the team against you and they have the peacemaker crystal armour dragon breath laser cannon. I mean with the new update they made it harder to get coins with also raising prices but at the point somehow everyone has the really expensive stuff. And one suggestion on sniper forts or whatever it's called how is.the prototype a sniper and I mean really the Dragon breath that guy that thought of the stuff I'm saying and done it you should probably change it back or else for a warning u will get lots of bad comments,0

clearly written by a journalist much as i found the content of the book fascinating if disturbing i felt that it was clear from the beginning that the writer was in fact a journalist by trade not a historian. i also found it deeply irritating how she felt she was solely responsible for keeping the story alive. overall i think there could have been more on the actual atrocities committed and a less sensationalist style would have helped.,0

"Arrived promptly, in excellent ocndition Arrived within 2 days as I had prime membership- excellent condition, as if it was fresh off the press! Love how cheap it is for literature students like me (I need to buy numerous books and the costs add up) and the language guidelines and explanations at the back help me a lot- I don't need to constantly go onto Google to look up the meaning of a word/ phrase and they give background info on history. The foreword is written incisively and in a thought-provoking way as well.<br /><br />With regards to the content, the story is written well, the descriptions are really vivid, but it is a rather depressing book for me- almost Grecian in its tragic ending (though some people may say otherwise).",1

"An Alien 3 review from an Alien and Horror fan. SPOILERS:<br />This film is a very good film by a fantastic director.<br />It is also maybe the most underrated horror film ever made. It's bleak tone, deep characters, mentaly damaged protagonist and great direction all carry the film.<br />There are some issues that keep this film from being truly great, like some of Finchers other films: Fight Club, Seven and Benjamin Button.<br />The main problem is the number of characters. Whilst it's realistic that there would be a lot of prisoners in the prison, there are too many and not enough get enough development. Only about 5 prisoner characters get any decent screen time, but don't get me wrong, the characters that the film focuses on are very interesting. They are all either rapists or murderers who have conformed to a semi-Christian religion, and the power of there faith helps them destroy the abominable evil that is the alien monster that starts killing the prisoners, as well as the human evil of the corporation that comes for the Alien in Ripley.<br />Second of all, the fake looking alien. For All those uneducated people saying that the alien is CGI, you are wrong. It's a rod puppet supper imposed on a green screen. The alien is actually very well animated and a lot of hard work went into its design and movement. But in a couple of scenes, the alien is visibly fake, for example: when one of the prisoners throws a flare, the alien looks round at him as it hangs off the roof. There is a clear green outline round it's head-collum.<br /><br />This isn't that much of an issue, mainly because the alien still remains threatening, and that I have real respect for the effects people who tried this rather experimental technique.<br /><br />The third and final real problem is that Hicks and Newt are killed of in the opening credits. This isn't really much of a problem either, to me at least, because this violent dismissle helps set the grim, depressing tone.<br />The reason I even mention it is that they were very good characters in the last film, especially Hicks. He was a major positive of Aliens, which is a film I've never been fond of due to its tonal shift from the dark, dank Alien.<br /><br />This film is very, very good. It has some strong religious themes and symbolism, for example: the twisted metal of an old reck forming a cross in one of the landscape shots. It has very deep and likeable characters, and dispite what Aliens fans say about it, this is the right kind of Tone for an Alien film. For me, Alein films are interesting because of the misteak of this horrifying, terrible creature that the characters know little about. It's unstoppable and evil and the only way the characters can survive is run.<br />Aliens just turned these demonic creatures into video game monsters, who were as easy to kill as stormtroopers. Aliens is a good action film, but it's not a good Alien film, in my personal opinion.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great horror film, with some very gory kills and some very memorable, likeable and interesting characters and a great sequel to Alien. I would HIGHLY recommend it.",1

"Why has this even been released? There are maybe 2 good songs on this album ( and not the 'new' songs either). Then there is a lot more of Bon Jovi. Let's face it Bon Jovi are dumb, their song writing is terrible and JBJ cannot sing to save his life. As he caterwauls from one dire power ballad to another I can almost hear Stephen Tyler laughing derisorily in his sleep. Richie Sambora is literally the most dull rock guitarist ever, if he had been shot in the back of the head at birth the world might have been spared this dire collection of forgettable \\""""hits\\"""" as, let's face it, Sambora is the brains of the operation and the true \\""""musical talent\\"""" behind the drippy, sappy Jon.<br /><br />Jon should stick to giving bored 40-somethings housewives (who are too self-loathing to fancy the vapid George Clooney) minor trembles and stop bawling synthetic emotion over tired hooks while he still has an iota of dignity left in his doddering, sub-rocker's frame. There have already been numerous \\""""best of\\"""" (which is at least a relative concept so trades descriptions wise they're fine) BJ's that it really becomes hard to see the motivation behind this release, other than the hope that the same fans who bought Crossroads have begun to start suffering from the onset of dementia and purchase this.

Avoid.<br /><br />Still- you do have to admit that \\""""Living on a Prayer\\"""" and \\""""Wanted Dead or Alive\\"""" are almost good enough to make it onto a collection of RATT outtakes and for that reason alone I give this collection its one star.",0

"American Psycho Two words describe this film, and they are provided by amazon in this review. &#34;It's Okay&#34;. There are good parts, but the whole movie is a puzzle as you sit there puzzled, thinking &#34;the hell is going on&#34;? There are classic scenes such as the death of paul. Scenes like that will make you chuckle just because of the way christian bale's character takes his time taking out a victim. Buy it if you are a christian bale fan, but if your looking for an amazing film to blow your mind, keep looking.",0
"Average is not good enough Firstly I want to start by saying that Nightwish are one of my favorite bands of all time. I was recommended them when I said to a friend that my favorite song of all time was Guns `n' Roses November Rain as I liked the orchestral intro with the rocking guitar solos of Slash. My friend then said try out Nightwish which is when 3 years ago I randomly bought Once and loved it and since have bought all of their other albums. Musically they are amazing, original, emotional, passionate and heavenly epic and reach the sort of musical perfection that only a few other bands are able achieve... these including Therion, Savatage and Metallica although others do come close. The problem is that Nightwish now only do this with the music the vocals are now average at best and for a band as big and as talented as Nightwish average simply is not good enough.        You can't blame Tuomas and co for sacking Tarja I would have done the same after the way she behaved towards the band and the dis-respect she showed. The following quote is taken from the very open letter posted on the bands website informing Tarja of her dismissal, She said \\""""I don't need Nightwish anymore.\\"""" and \\""""Remember, Tuomas, that I could leave this band at any time, giving you only one day's warning in advance\\"""". Now ask yourself a question would you want to be in the same band as someone like this?        Now I don't want to be overly critical of Anette because she isn't horrible she just does not suit the sound that Nightwish have created over the last 11 years. I believe that Nightwish could gave picked their new vocalist better my first choices would have been Simone Simmons (Epica), Floor Jansen (After Forever) or (The one from Tristania). All I believe have more powerful voices and suit the image of Nightwish far more. I hope myself that between now and when they start recording their new album they replace Anette with one of these vocalists. I feel that Nightwish should have if they were unable to get anyof these during the recording of DPP they should have made it an album where Marco was lead vocalist with the choir backing him up, making it kind of an interlude album between new and old vocalist. This may sound as if it wouldn't work but I'm sure with the intelligence and creativity of this bands musical arrangements and abilities it could have been made to work.        Now on to the album itself...    Despite what I've said on DPP you will find some of the most beautiful and mesmerizing music they have created so far it's just that it's only 70% as good as what it could have been.     1) The Poet and the Pendulum*- This is the greatest song on the album and one of, if not the greatest song the band have so far recorded. It has everything (almost), fast and slower parts, the contrast between male and female vocals, loud and quiet parts with instrumental solos and beautiful lyrics. The only things it's missing are quality female vocals and a jaw dropping guitar solo from Emppu who is far more talented than he shows in this band so far... Despite this it's amazing and gives you a 14 minute glimpse of what heaven must feel like. 10/10    2) Bye Bye Beautiful- The Wish I Had an Angel of DPP. 9/10     3) Amaranth- One of the worst songs on DPP and one of their worst ever. Simply to poppy which means it has no guts and no oomph. Clearly the record labels attempt at being commercial, and a song Tuomas himself didn't actually want on the album. Worst song ever on a Nightwish album 2.8/10    4) Cadence of Her Last Breath- An ok song but nothing that amazing. 6.1/10    5) Master Passion Greed- The heaviest song Nightwish have done so far with an ok beat and nothing more. It's not that I don't like heavy songs I love Romanticide off Once. This song just isn't in that class though. 4.3/10    6) Eva- An ok ballad. 5.5/10    7) Sahara*- A great song about the desert, the music truly conjures up images of Egypt and the Sahara desert, with a great ending when the choir comes inat full blast. 8.2/10    8) Whoever Brings the Night- A decent song but considering it was written by Emppu you would have expected some sort of guitar solo to at least attempt to rival those of Slash, the `tallica boys,  Alexi Laiho or Matt Heafy and Corey Beaulieu From Trivium, but it never comes. 6.3/10    9) For the Heart I once Had-  Average. 5.1/10    10) The Islander- An original and unexpected song that is well worth its place on the album. 8.2/10    11) Last of the Wilds- A fantastic Celtic sounding instrumental. 8.4/10    12) 7 Days to the Wolves*- One of my personal favorites. Has a great musical change at the 3 minute mark and a great beat and powerful vocals from Marco. 9.2/10    13) Meadows of Heaven*- A fantastic end with epic orchestral compositions and a powerful gospel choir ending you have to hear this song to believe its power. 9.3/10    Bonus Track:    14) The Escapist- This song stars off with a nice violin piece before the guitars come in. Annette sounds decent in this song, and the lyrics are good. This song although only a bonus track is a lot better than some of the songs on the main play list and should definitely have replaced Amaranth or at the very least For the Heart I Once Had. 6.4/10      Overall Rating 7.05    Highlights*    Could have been the best Nightwish album so far but fell short of Once by quite a margin. There are too many average songs being led by vocals that aren't worthy of the almighty Nightwish. Like myself Nightwish fans will like this album but will be left feeling slightly disappointed. You will be left wondering what could have been given more thought and time, wondering how it would have sounded with Tarja on the vocals. I in my head can hear her singing The Poet and the Pendulum and 7 Days to the Wolves and I think they would have been orgasmically good. Despite these problems Nightwish are still the best symphonic metal band along with Therion. The best way to describe them is \\""""Nightwish at their worst are still better than other bands at their best\\"""", a description by another reviewer on Amazon and 100% accurate.",0

"This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read, and I've read plenty. The subject of cancer is both a frightening and mysterious one. There are few people - if indeed any - who have not been affected in some way by it, or at least been exposed to it through friends or family. My wife had Hodgkin's Lymphoma (one of the rare forms of cancer generally curable in 85% of sufferers) in her early twenties, and my aunt recently had a mastectomy. I have always understood cancer to be a diverse and highly aggressive genetic mutation of some kind, but have never really understood what it is. I can't exactly claim to be an expert now, but I can say that I finally understand what it is, what causes it and why it remains so difficult to treat successfully.  The understanding is both a relief and somewhat frightening. A relief because I suffer mysteries poorly, and frightening because to understand what cancer is is also to understand that avoiding the malady completely is largely a game of chance, a  genetic lottery of sorts in which lifestyle and habits play only a partial role in determining who will fall prey. There is also a rather tragic irony to cancer, in that age is a major factor in its own right. One very significant factor in the increase of cancer in recent decades comes down to the simple fact of increased life expectancy.<br /><br />Then there is the subject of the disease itself and the chronology of research and discoveries which have culminated in the ongoing effort to fully map the cellular composition and inherent mutations in most common forms. It's a fascinating journey of brilliance, dedication, politics and human folly that has left me at times both in wonder of some, and incredulous at the obstinacy of others. The book parallels this story with the equally harrowing account of the evolution of cancer treatment, two sides of the same coin which remained surprisingly isolated from each other until only recently.<br /><br />All of these things, and much more, are studiously covered in this book. And yet despite the complex nature of the biology involved, not to mention the chemistry, the book is written in a way that leaves no relevant fact out, yet is genuinely easy - I'd even say pleasantly so - to read.<br /><br />If, like me, you're one of those people who just needs to know; this is the book for you. Equally, I would recommend it to anyone who is, or has ever been, affected by cancer, either directly or indirectly, if you want a greater understanding of what is happening and why (my wife is now reading it). I have no official capacity in which to suggest it would be of therapeutic value, yet I instinctively believe it might well be.<br /><br />Either way, the author has done an absolutely outstanding job of bringing this age old mystery within easy grasp of anyone who chooses to understand it. I can honestly say I was taken aback by the elegance, thoroughness and clarity of the book, and cannot praise mister Mukherjee enough for his effort.re of the biology involved, not to mention the chemistry, the book is written in a way that leaves no relevant fact out, yet is genuinely easy - I'd even say pleasantly so - to read.<br /><br />If, like me, you're one of those people who just needs to know; this is the book for you.

"Oh dear... I bought the vinyl edition, I should have waited and listend to some ones cd before dumping £26.99 on this \\""""left overs from parts bin\\"""" (how many Led Zep fans that bought Coda, played it more than once?) For sound quality the music only covers the first half of each side of the disc, so you are jumping up every 12 minutes or so, but trying to make audiofile records from heavely prosessed rock music, to my ears, is pointless and it could easely have been pressed on one disc of quality vinyl.

It keeps all seven novels in one place.<br /><br />The box is striking and sturdy, and the covers are lovely, although I can't help feeling they are a bit flimsy. This could be just my own wee gripe, after all, it is the content of the books themselves that far exceed a 5 star rating.<br /><br />This set is very nice for the price, and a great gift idea too - however if you are thinking of buying it to hand down to children and grandchildren, I would opt for the hardcover boxset instead.",0

"Sound but Simple This book offers a valid insight into the dilemma faced by many small business owners: how to balance the role of entrepreneur, manager and technician.  The author gives good advice, reminding business owners not just to concentrate on technical work; indeed, as the author points out, you should work on your business, not in it. However, the book never really kicks on past this rather laboured point and consequently the book could probably be significantly condensed.     Worthwhile if only to remind business owners where their priorities should lie, but not the most thought-provoking book you'll ever read.",0

This book has opened me up to the world of Agatha Christie and I am glad to have read it! I will definitely be reading more of her books.,1
Very good for kids that are learning I will buy again! Very good for kids that are learning English,1
Five Stars Excellent,1
"this is pretty good. However As far as 80's Hard Rock goes, this is pretty good. However, there are only a handful of tracks that stand out and unless you generally like the majority of material on it, you might be better off simply buying those songs as singles.",0

From a fifty shades fan I did enjoy it, however did get pretty repetitive, and at some points felt it was a little too dark and twisted!",0

"you don't need this book Within the first few days of having my little one, I wanted to throw this book out the window. Though there are some good tips, if your baby does not miraculously fall into this pattern, you start to feel a failure. My baby fell alseep in her feeds so EASY would not work. However as she has got older, she has naturally got into a good pattern. My advice: trust your own mothering instincts and get to know your baby, they are all different. I'm not going to mess with her cycle if she feeds more in the day but sleeps 8 hours a night!!",0

"Takes a long time to get going Iv read all three books and found fifty shades of grey very borring, I had to keep reading though just to find out what was going to happen.<br />The third book fifty shades freed had the best plot and I think concluded very nicely. The book was very unbelievable but I did over all like it after it got going in the second book.<br />There is a lot of sex in the book and found my self skipping a bit of it out as it became very relative as if it had just been copied and pasted.",0

"Hidden fees and hard to install This app has proved very difficult to install for someone without a computer degree. Support did get back to me, but it didn't work. I have tried purchasing it twice, firstly I bought the basic app, then I found out I had to pay double again for premium to print more than 20 pages. Then premium small print said it was a monthly fee to keep printing, which at first appeared to be a one off fee.<br />I am still waiting for two of the refunds and have wasted 20 pounds and a lot of time.<br />If it did work for a one off unlimited fee it would be great. I'd try some of the free apps first. This one has been quite frustrating.",0

One Star Didn't work!,0
UNHAPPY Got this for my sons birthday as he loves animals.<br /><br />I placed the DVD into the DVD player and it did not work.  The DVD player did not pick up the DVD. I took it to HMV and asked them to have a look and they told me that the DVD was blank and that is why it would not work.<br /><br />My Friend then placed the DVD into the DVD player unaware that it does not work and it got stuck in the DVD Player.<br /><br />So I had an unhappy son as he did not get to see his film and he had a broken DVD Player.,0
Five Stars very good.,1
Ok book Was very excited about getting this as I loved the first one however defiantly not as good.<br />The item however was as described and arrived quickly.,0
"sensational i had this book pre ordered since it was released on amazon so it came on the day it was released, i thought about what else she could do with this book all year and my god was i shocked. The twists and turns the whole way though, crying my eyes out when a character was hurt and then being emotionally drained at the end of it (you will know what i mean if you have read it)i really don't know how she does it. I was captivated throughout the book hoping and wishing that everyone would be fine. I wont write much else as i will just end up spilling my guts and all the spoilers that come with it but all i can say for now is, Well bloody done. IT WAS A SENSATIONAL READ!",1
"Living With Covers As cover album go, this is all right. Its nice that Young hasn't done a Johnny Cash, by re-imaging contempary songs, but taking on old American Folk songs, which is interesting, considering he's Canadian.<br />Highlights would be \\""""High Flyin' Birds\\"""" & \\""""Wayfarin stranger\\"""".  Lowlights,  \\""""God Save the Queen\\"""", I think Hendrix has cornered the market on national anthems!<br />Production wise, it has a \\""""Chrome Dreams 2\\""""  although I feel the studio banter between the songs sounds a little contrived.<br />So I think this would be classed one of his\\""""experimental\\""""\\"""" Albums, Which is why we love Neil young so much.<br />As for the score, if it was out of 10, I would give 7/10, but it's only five so I can only give 3/5 (its not worth 4/5)<br /> Oh, if your into Covers Albums, you may be interested in \\""""Meet Glenn Cammbell\\""""",0

Good CD Bought this because my partner had heard it played on the radio and liked it. I was a bit doubtful because it was produced by Damon Albarn and I think it's a bit too Gorillaz for me. But what the hey! She likes it.,0

"too thin by far Being honest at the time of writing this review, I've not read &#34;Be careful what you wish for&#34; and I don't suppose I shall either now thanks to the five star review already given. The first two books in the Clifton Chronicles were very good, the third was poor and far fetched. I might have read volume four it it had completed the saga, just to see what happens, but according to the five star review the story continues into volume five. Well Mr Archer, enough is enough.",0

"A MUST HAVE for any Deadhead 3 good CD's of a brilliant concert.  Some bests ever.  The sound is very good (but then so was the Charlie Miller remastered soundboard, if you knew how to get that), the best now available.<br /><br />The DVD is a must have too.  Film of the Aug 27 1972 concert is mixed with fascinating films of Neal Cassady, Ken and the Pranksters, and the Dead playing at Acid Test 6 at the Fillmore 8 Jan '66.  In retrospect Jan 66 and Aug 72 are only 6 1/2 years apart, but what a world-changing 6 years they were, and the Dead were at the very centre of that.",1

"Very Pale Imitation Read all the other 'rave' reviews about this album, Brit nominations and Mercury prizes, how it was a breath of fresh air.......well that says a lot about the current state of the music industry if this is as good as it gets.<br />I would describe this album as a 'pale imitation' of Moby's 'Play' album, which was actually a true masterpiece and a divergence from the music industry's norm almost 15 years ago.<br />How relevant ALT J's music is I'm not sure, everyone has had a go at including folk influences recently, some to a greater success than others but not here.<br />Sorry ALT J but I'm afraid that when I'm next sorting my music library it'll be CTRL X for this album !!",0
"So, so I just thought it was a bit stuck between a zombie movie and a vampire movie.  Not a bad story/plot by any means but a bit pedestrian in delivery.  Probably one for true vampire buffs.",0
"Best of the four!   Warning: contains spoilers Love this so much, it's abit like [[ASIN:B00ABNZSRG The Guest (THE TWO VAMPIRES)]]which I also loved, but breaking dawn is longer so kept me occupied! I admit that I'm reading this book again, probably for the 3rd time now, but I wanted to read it again before seeing the film so the imagery wouldbe fresh. I like Bella better as a vampire and I love her daughter.",1

how to ruin a wonderful story this must be one of the worst attempt to portray the wonderful story  the of wuthering heights i have ever had the miss fortune to see do not buy this film it has lost the whole point of the love and passion behind the story its like someone has taken a highlighter pen to the book and missed out the key parts of the story just skipping through with no feel for what actually took place in the original story,0
okay If it were not for the lives taking a while to reloaded and no way of earning crystals then this game would receive more stars. However it is a good game which can be quite addictive.,0

"Vomit inducing! I love Jamie's other books but this is badly thought out for people with few or no taste buds.  As I type this I have the book in front of me and the first 218 pages are rendered utterly useless as none of the recipes appeal to me at all.  I am not going to list the recipes as everyone else seems to have done it already, saving me the effort.  Its only saving grace are the veggie and breakfast sections at the back, including a small section on toasties, but the rest is vomit inducing reading!  30 minute meals was a winner, stick to that Jamie, more of the same please.",0
"hunger games I started out with high expectations of these books because of the publicity surrounding them. The first volume was mildly entertaining but the scenarios had limited credibility and the love triangle with innnocent encounters left a lot to be desired. The second volume simply prolonged the agony and the third provided a somewhat gory 'happy' ever after. Perhaps an extra couple of chaperts at the end of the first volume, and forget the other two volumes. Some touching moments but not on my read again list.",0
"Overly florid style and a plot that feels rushed. I'd still recommend it. I'm one of those deporable people who watched the TV Series before I read this book, and I must say my main annoyance with it is the writing style. What seemed slightly pretentious in the first episode of Dexter had me wincing in the first chapter of the book. I just felt like Lindsay was trying much too hard, at some points the adjectives used felt childish even; as if someone had thought of all the long words they could possibly use. Luckily, after the first chapter things settle down and improve vastly.    Once you get used to the slightly simplistic style and settle into the book it's incredibly enjoyable. While the plot isn't as complicated as the TV show, it's still different enough, and imaginative enough to not be boring. Also with the book there are more amusing insights into how Dexter reacts to social situations, which is the main reason why I watched the series.    The characters in the book are very interesting, and Lindsay has managed to give you a detailed picture of the nature of everyone you meet, without filling pages. This is welcome and effective concision after the opening chapter.    So the book has it's flaws, and I felt a little put out when I started it because it's not quite the slick and effective narrative that I was expecting, but I will be buying the next few in the series, and I'm sure I'll enjoy them even more.",0
"Brilliant Brilliant, truly brilliant",1
Five Stars very good,1
"Getting bored Only on page 70 and getting bored.  I feel that the dialogue,language and conversations in the book seem too modern for the period it's supposed to be set in.  I can imagine each character having a cheesy American accent and it just isn't working for me.  Should I carry on reading it?  Will it get any better?    I normally read on the train to and from work, and I usually get sucked into whatever book I'm reading; with this I'm getting distracted by what's going on around me.",0
LOVED IT Loved this CD.  Great tracks and vocals.,1
CARS DRIVING ON SAND HAS NEVER BEEN MORE ENTERTAINING Epic action packed visually stunning peice of work definitely worth your time even if you have never seen the original trilogy with Mel Gibson that should not matter or put you of this movie which can stand alone on its own feet,1

Badly written but a light read Bought this as a present someone asked for tbut feel am qualified to review as I had already read it.  For me it's like &#34;Twilight&#34; with sex and I think it's badly written and the only reason it got so popular was because of the sex and various sexual and other practises in it.  The heroine really annoys me as she is such a  pushover and doesn't seem to have a mind or will of her own.  Friends were agog at the sex bits in it but all I can say is they must have led very protected lives!,0

"good Cold War spy story, if that's what you  want Well written and plotted story, as convoluted as you'd expect from John le Carre but not as long as some of his others.  It just made me realise that I've not got much time for spies and spying.  I'm unconvinced that there was any genuine purpose behind the scheming and killing.  Despite having lived through the Cold War and accepting that the USSR did pose a potentially serious threat to our national security, this book just gave me the feeling that it was all rather a nasty game, with several opposing teams competing for the Machiavelli award for deviousness - penalty for failure - death.",0
it's like clash of clans. I think that clash of clans is of the same type of game and if you like clash of clans you may like this as well. Even if you want a game that you can raid poeple on this is it.,1

"Amusing in parts - although I'm not sure if it's intended! So how to describe this offering?<br />Basically, take a girl-assassin film such as 'Nikita', add the young girl and the darker bits of 'Leon', add the South America gang bits of 'Scarface', stir in some total nonsense action from any number of films and a few of the fight scenes from the 'Bourne' series, and you get Colombiana.<br /><br />A young girl, Catalaya, witnesses the death of her parents at the hands of a Colombian gang boss - I'm not really sure we ever found out why - and then she already displays great powers to overcome and escape from the baddies.  She travels to be raised as an assassin by a relative in Chicago, and as she grows up her quest for revenge starts.  The body count soon mounts and in creative style.<br /><br />Some good action which saves it a bit, but a pretty basic 'been there before' plot. Where Jason Bourne can fight the killers with a rolled up magazine, Catalaya manages it with a toothbrush!<br /><br />It almost seemed to degenerate into a spoof at some points.<br /><br />Enjoy it, laugh at it, then forget about it!",0

I had no sympathy with either Nick or Amy, and I can't say my life has been enriched by reading all about their warped relationship!

"One of the greatest rock albums of all time in an appalingly bad remaster \\""""The Number Of The Beast\\"""" is an absolute classic, a landmark album in music/rock/metal history. And this reissue is an absolute disaster, with the classic cover printed in wrong colors, and the audio victimized by the infamous \\""""loudness war\\"""" (Google the expression if you don't know what it means), with the music having been turned into one big mass of distorted noise. I did a full audio analysis of the whole album and just can't understand how the band's label could have let this precious material fall into the hands of inept audio engineers capable of producing something this amateurish.    Add to that the inclusion of track \\""""Total Eclipse\\"""" - which was not part of the original vinyl or even the first CD releases - between tracks \\""""Gangland\\"""" and \\""""Hallowed Be Thy Name\\"""", something that completely breaks the perfect continuity of the album. That track only started to appear in the 1995 reissues in a separate bonus disc.    I wonder if the band had any say in these \\""""enhanced\\"""" releases. Avoid this thing and buy an older, non-enhanced and non-remastered CD edition of the album if you want to hear how this masterpiece is really supposed to sound. Shame on EMI for releasing this insult to the band and their fans.",0

"Abysmal. I had heard more bad than good reviews on this book, but thought I would read it myself and make up my own mind.<br /><br />The first thing that strikes me is the authors complete lack of vocabulary. The girl (Ana) blushes on every page, but is gets exhausting to read because it's the same thing over and over. And Mr Grey constantly 'cocks his head'. She's found an expression she likes and abused it throughout.<br /><br />The characters are annoying, especially the girl. I can't help but think she's a moron. She says and does things a 12 year old would at the beginning of the book and you really just feel a bit annoyed. I personally wanted to beat her. I assume we are supposed to like her, and sympathise with her but it's frustrating.<br /><br />The story itself is alright, but everything is far too off putting to make a point of reading it. It's not shocking or exciting, and it's too repetitive.<br /><br />I wont be reading the sequels.",0

"Interesting but takes imagination away On one of Jupiter's moons, Apes and Mankind become transfixed with a mysterious black slab known as the Monolith.    Has there ever been such an influential look into the future of mankind than Stanley Kubrick's Oscar winning picture? Whether it is the finest depiction of future in cinematic history remains to be foreseen but it is easily one of the finest Sci-Fi films of all time with it's exquisite direction, a wonderful story (that hardly makes any sense which makes it fun to decode) and some of the finest visuals seen in the 60's which opened the door for Star Wars amongst others.    Having loved the film to the point of obsession I decided to read the novel to see how much the book differed from the screenplay. Cinema adaptations are funny creations. They can work wonders for any age and span a massive worldwide phenomenon (Harry Potter) or they can leave you so disappointed you wish you had never read the book or comic (Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason) Often the reason an adaptation is disliked is because it takes the magic of imagination from a novel and bizarrely, this book takes all the imagination away from the picture.    I confess I watched the film before reading the book. I was told of the film's ruthful depiction of a possible future and its sheer originality and I wasn't to be disappointed. The main reason the film works is because it asks questions and doesn't answer any, it is truly amazing.     However I wanted to find some answers and to see what was really behind the scope of Hal and the mystery of the Monolith. And when reading there was so much information, so much scientific jargon and a vivid description that I found it took the shine off the mysterious 1968 Oscar winner. Whereas there is no doubting Clarke's talent as a writer and an artist in imagination, there is a feeling here that he is divulging way too much information. Kubrick's picture is so farfetched and so unrealistic of anything ever put onto screen before that it feels almosta crime to find out the scientific reason behind everything on screen.    Clarke's imagination is wonderful and though this is a well written interesting read, I found myself finishing it half way through as the information behind scenes from the film were being destroyed.    The importance of imagination and possibility is what the film generates and to have that spoilt will be to ruin perhaps some of the finest sci-fi cinema ever created.     Watch the film instead of reading this book, for you are guaranteed more excitement and by far greater imagination into a possible future.",0
"amazing game, buggy piece of shit If you asked me to rate the games concept and design, 6/5 every time. However, every 5-15 minutes, it crashes and you have to force restart (hold down power button for 10 seconds) your whole kindle. This loses all progress as it is online and can be ridiculously frustrating as many times, I had an extremely commanding lead(34-7). If you value your rank, extremely bad.

"Disappointing Having read all of the Jack Reacher novels prior to this I was expecting another original and exciting story. Sadly I was extremely disappointed with this one.  So full of clique'd plots and situations it can only be explained by the current US obsession with terrorists and Lee Child must have been having a 'creative vacation' for this one and possibly a real writers hangover of a block. If I hadnt seen it was written by Lee Child and the main character was Jack reacher, it would have been easy to imagine it was written by any of several dozen mediocre authors including Dan Brown (which is no compliment at all).  I know from all the previous books that Lee Childs has the ability to write some of the most exciting and original novels so I'll be looking for his next one and hoping he puts the tallent and effort into it that was apparent from all his previous book - I hope this one was just an aberation.",0

"The album that never goes out I will start by saying that before I heard this album, I did not like The Smiths. They didn't fit into the heavy metal scene which I enjoy but also seemed rather 'self indulgent' to me..perhaps that was just Morrissey. But after hearing 'The Queen is Dead' for the first time, my life was changed completely. And for the better. Without this band ( and especially this album) I wouldn't be the person (vegetarian, naturally, thanks to the brilliant 'Meat is Murder') that I am today.<br />I'm 17, so I was never alive while The Smiths were actually together, however this album is an absolute MASTERPIECE!! Every single track feels like a classic- from the oddly amusing 'Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty' which segues into the fantastic drum intro of the title track..and my word, WHAT A TITLE TRACK. 'The Queen is Dead' really sets the mood for what's to come from the rest of the album, with incredible guitar from Johnny Marr and plenty of humour (yet naturally with a touch of sadness) from Morrissey's lyrics. I don't think Morrissey ever sounded better on a record than he does on 'The Queen is Dead'.<br />Funny tracks like 'Frankly Mr Shankly' and 'Vicar in a Tutu'...Pure lyrical wit on 'Cemetery Gates' and 'The Boy With The Thorn in His Side' and of course, the wonderful 'There is A Light and it Never Goes Out'...As well as my personal fave 'Bigmouth Strikes Again' all help to make this a record you simply cannot forget. Of course...all the other songs on this album aren't just filler for the hits, every piece seems to be in the right place on the album, changing the mood but with overall very positive results. The album can make you laugh and make you weep...but it is definitely something I recommend everybody experience in their life. 'The Queen is Dead' is a perfect album...and I don't say that about many albums. The vinyl edition is also very nice as the artwork is bigger and inside the gatefold has the lyrics printed, with a nice record sleeve too. Cannot recommend itenough, buy it right now!",1
"Faded memory I know that I used to love this album. Had not played it for years and did not have it on CD so bought a copy in the sure and certain hope of reliving the happy memory.<br />Oh dear! For me it had sadly not stood the test of time very well. Ah well, you win some you lose some",0
"Time for a new voiceover track! My version says 200 mins, copyright 1985, 1997 Bavarian Film.  Thirty years ago, twenty years ago, about events now seventy years ago.  The Jewish propaganda version of WW2 still seems to rule with Amazon commentators. Just three comments:-<br />[1] This film is in my view simply too light on technology: how did they know where they were? How did they get radio messages? How often did they need to surface? How did the engines work? These boats were technogically advanced. The result is a kind of schoolboyish gee-whiz, lacking technical backbone.<br />[2] It is low budget: there's no view of how the high command saw things, what was happening, what they thought they were doing.  Fair enough in a film, and no doubt how wars are perceived by most of those involved, but a bit restricting.  Views from outside often have a buckets-of-water-thrown-over-the-actors feel.<br />[3] Maybe a new genre will arise, involving new scripts and voiceovers, as a sort of samizdat film.  The sort of thing I mean is comments on Churchill having declared war on Germany, which many people in the west don't seem to know.  And France having declared war at the same time.  They might sing, instead of 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary', one of the songs by (say) Charlie and his Orchestra - 'The Man with the Big Cigar' perhaps? Maybe something on mass murder by Jews in the USSR, and their fears about Stalin invading Europe.  Or perhaps bombing of Germany and France, with some detail of 'Bomber Harris' and his actions against civilians.  Or perhaps stories of how America was inveigled into war.  Or accounts from WW1 of naval blockades causing starvation in Germany, probably of some interest to the crew.  Or maybe accounts of Poland and the varying borders with Germany.  Plenty of possibilities - intelligent students of film might try their own voiceovers and/or subtitles!",0
Very poor Cars with wings. No wonder Pixar gave this a wide berth. If you liked Cars then you won't like this. There is no refinement or script and even kids will find it boring. What's next? Boats? Trains? Come on disney!!!!,0

"I love this movie I love this movie, but the 3D effects aren't up to Disney's standards. Either that or my expectations were high. I was expecting something along the lines of How To Train Your Dragon which is one of the best 3D films I own, but I found Maleficent a bit fuzzy.",1
"Disappointing Antony's voice is of course wonderful but there isn't really that much made of the orchestra. I found the use of an orchestra on a couple of tracks on the Swanlights album really interesting.<br />On this live album though it seems a little too underplayed. Take 'Another World' for example which has a slow almost inaudible string intro and then is basically piano and vocals. It's good but not really offering any more than the original.<br />Future Feminism, 7 and half minutes of spoken Antony whimsy might be amusing/interesting live but on CD seems a complete pretentious self indulgence.<br />The tracks are songs from his 4 albums with an earlier single 'I Fell In Love With A Dead Boy' (which is very hard to track down elsewhere) and one new track 'Cut the World'.<br />The orchestral aspect works best on tracks like 'I Fell In Love With A Dead Boy', 'Cripple And The Starfish', 'Kiss My Name' and 'Swanlights'.<br />Okay but not as different as I anticipated.",0

"Five Stars Beautiful story to read to your children, beautifully written :)",1
Okay at best I like both the stars in this movie however neither is known for having a consistent track record with making good movies. that been said I thought this would be okay and it was. Just okay though. It's one of those really average movies that are only just interesting enough to hold your interest. Nothing special happens and there's no particularly amazing scenes. It passes 90 minutes without giving you anything to really love or hate.,0
ok I love this game but ever since last update I can't open it gutted coz it's been about a month now! Please fix,0

"thinly disguised romance Quite interesting from a historical point of view but couldn't help feeling that I was reading an epic family based novel from any era with a formulaic style to capture the reader in love, romance, sex, betrayal, hypocrisy and corruption. Its a story - no clever literary tricks or delicious use of the english language and interesting sentence/paragraph structure. Nevertheless very readworthy for those who like a good story. Have heard author compared with Sansom - but can't possibly agree!",0

"Thought provoking. I think that Richard Dawkins book “The Magic of Reality” is excellent in that it achieves exactly what it sets out to do.<br />Children are fed false information about the world around us in just about every country in the world. They are also taught to obey their parents and that what their parents say is correct. This process has been described as child abuse. This book goes a long way to try and correct this terrible situation.<br />I am writing this review in 2014 where the number of religious people in the world is about 80% (give or take). The most well-funded and extreme religious terrorist organisation the world has ever seen is sweeping across Africa and the Middle East.<br />Richard, in this book is very careful to stick to what he knows and when he doesn’t know he says so. For example in chapter 9 “Are we alone?” he admits in the end that we just don’t know.<br />A very thought provoking book for school children and adults.",1
"She's not bad, she's just drawn that way..... The book was great, innovative storyline, great storytelling skills. The graphic novel is a little different. For a start it's written from the point of view of one of the other main characters and this takes a bit of getting used to; some of the things included don't match the original book at all.<br />Oh, and her breasts, although in the book they were described as ample, in the graphic they start out as ample and end up so large that I'm amazed she can stand upright without toppling over and nailing herself to the floor with her large and very obvious nipples. Maybe this is because it was drawn by a guy and he's let his fertile imagination run away with him. And someone may want to break it to him that the bigger they are the further they can drop, especially when you don't wear a bra.",0
"A darkly romantic, erotic novel that is a compelling read albeit slightly disturbing in places. I have mixed opinions on E.L James' `fifty shades of grey' novel which has been met with such high acclaim, being the book that `everyone is talking about'. This love-hate relationship that I have with this piece of literature is tearing me apart, for typically one is usually able to tell whether they like a book or not. The character-study was superb with Anastasia Steel and Christian Grey being attractive, interesting characters who were the perfect `Bella and Edward' couple. The intense drama and electric tension between them radiates off the page, as you loose yourself within a captivating tale of mutual attraction and lust. The dark, sinister secrets that Christian Grey keeps hidden adds to the depth of fascination that one gets with reading this book, as you are constantly seeking out what lies beneath the surface...Unlike books that I love (such as the Twilight saga by Stephanie Meyer for example), is the mature sexual content within this novel that is a little too explicit, graphic and disturbing for rational reading. I found parts very disconcerting, as it distracted from the main characters relationship, which could have been projected to the reader with more sincerity, deepness and authenticity if it had of been `toned down a little bit'.<br /><br />This is however an exceptional adult novel, as I was truly addicted to these characters making this book a guilty pleasure and tantalizingly tempting treat! The passionately physical affair does get a little `over the top' and I certainly feel that if the author had focused more on the content and quality of prose rather than just sex, this would have created something of a much higher standard. Highly readable, interesting and enchanting you will be drawn into this heated, intense love affair that is shrouded in secrets, mystery and intrigue. E L James' concept as a whole is inspired, very well-written and cleverly crafted but sadly the fantastic storyline and detailed narrative gets lost within their sexual activities...which ultimately seems to be Never-ending!<br /><br />When literature student Anastasia Steele interviews successful entrepreneur Christian Grey, she finds him very attractive and deeply intimidating. Convinced that their meeting went badly, she tries to put him out of her mind - until he turns up at the store where she works part-time, and invites her out. Unworldly and innocent, Ana is shocked to find she wants this man. And, when he warns her to keep her distance, it only makes her want him more. But Grey is tormented by inner demons, and consumed by the need to control. As they embark on a passionate love affair, Ana discovers more about her own desires, as well as the dark secrets Grey keeps hidden away from public view...<br /><br />It is Christian Grey's singular erotic tastes that at first capture your attention to then nauseate, hence those who enjoy dark erotic fiction will love this; but perhaps not myself. *Note:  This book is intended for mature audiences*activities...which ultimately seems to be Never-ending!<br /><br />When literature student Anastasia Steele interviews successful entrepreneur Christian Grey, she finds him very attractive and deeply intimidating.

A great read for any wannabe rockstar!! This book is amazing!! Being a fan of anthony and RHCP since childhood i decided i wanted to find out more about the man behind the music and i was not dissapointed!! this book definitely opened my eyes to who anthony is as a person and i will say this - when anthony was younger he was a bit of a douchebag!! I will also say though as you follow his story you definitely see him grow as a person and although when i started reading the book i was unpleasantly surprised by his personality i finished the book still loving him the way i did before reading it. If you enjoy this book i also recommend you read ozzy osbournes book & the dirt by motley crue (my favourite rockstar book ever),1

"Really? Not that great to be honest Although Sandra & Ryan manage just about to pull this story off with enough humour, the general plot is absolute rot. I saw this film at the cinema with a friend & although it was watchable it was hardly a good hour an and half spent.   I wouldn't even really rate it as an ok chick flick. I was quite disappointed and i wouldn't pay to watch this again, i believe there are lots of other chick films to watch with more imagination.",0
"I hate writing negative long reviews but i feel a need ... I hate writing negative long reviews but i feel a need to on this book. I found this book a bit of a chore so gave up on page 70 thinking it would get better but it didn't<br /><br />I borrowed this book off a friend and all I can say is I don't understand why this book has all the 5 star ratings. One of the most boring  book I've ever read. Let's just say I will NEVER buy one of this authors books I. The near future.<br /><br /> I've heard so many great things about this book but I found myself rather disappointed in it.<br /> After 55 pages I personally find that the author was very uninteresting, dull and highly boring. All this book was about was the ramblings of an old man (assuming he is) with poor literacy skills.<br /><br /> I also got highly frustrated with the amount of times the author told us that he was a writer. Well hello that's obvious as you've written a book<br /><br /> I feel that this book was may of been &#34;unfinished&#34; and I also felt the author is very &#34;uninspiring&#34; in trying to get more people into running I certainly will not be taking up running anytime soon",0

"Mixed Feelings Wow, 3000 plus reviews! Surely a pop hit, but I had mixed feelings about this read. Martel's writing is subtle and dry but it's a VERY slow starter and then drifts into the realms of subtext-heavy story-telling, like Jonathan Livingston Seagull or The Alchemist.  As other reviewers say, it isn't preacy but it does have that New Age hip feel that lessens the experience for me. Good in parts, calculated in parts, ultimately a frustrating read.",0
"Don't believe the hype This is presumably a glimpse of where Tony Abbott is taking Australia.<br /><br />Are film reviewers entirely corrupt nowadays?  98% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes- really?  Just another dumb, dull, loud action movie.  The plot is basically a chase up a road and then back again.  I kid you not.  Objectively the film probably deserves 3 stars but just being mediocre surely isn't enough in a film with this much hype.",0
"Yes 2014 I well understand why this album is dividing people so much. When I read interviews with the band and the producer, I was wondering what will be the output from a line-up with a keyboardist who I find more pop than prog-rock oriented, a singer I have never heard of, produced by a guy who was behind very radio friendly Queen music.<br /><br />This album is not a prog rock album. At least not as I understand prog. Except for Subway Walls, which is actually really good piece of music, it is radio friendly pop. Somebody called it a great summer album. Well, as I write this review, it is September and what will I do with it for the rest of the year? In autumn, winter and spring? Even some lyrics are very summary.<br /><br />I don't really care about genres too much, if I like the music, that's enough for me. So this album being pop doesn't really matter to me. There are things I like (melodies, Chris' bass lines, Subway Walls) and there are things I don't like (songs feel rushed, they just scratch the surface, everything is high pitched). Overall, I feel it's ok. Not great, not complete rubbish. There are some parts when I feel Steve Howe and Geoff Downes were recording at home to a different tempo or something, some of the phrasing is just off. Drums are quite lazy. I wouldn't play it better for sure, but I am not a prog rock legend ...<br /><br />I was thinking what is missing, because there is something missing. This album just doesn't have balls. The heaviest riff is in This Was All We Knew, which is exactly the song with summer lyrics. It's just kind of floating, weightlessly, it is not grounded, it doesn't have deep roots, solid foundations - deep bass, noticeable bass drum, all 88 keys of a keyboard.",0

"Part of a much larger package This book contains a short introduction to the topics, with a large number of sample questions.

"He recorded all fifteen symphonies with the cologne Radio Orchestra but the WDR Sinfonieorchester are even better here. I urge a All fifteen symphonies by the recognized major composer of the last Century, conducted by Rudolf Barshai who knew Shostakovitch well, studied with him and  is well-known as a Master of Soviet music, as well as for standing up to the massive bureaucratic resistance and in close collaboration with the composer gave the first performance of Shostakovitch's Fourteenth Symphony in 1969 . Barshai was a founding member of the Borodin Quartet and has conducted Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms and Mahler with most of the major orchestras of the world. His knowledge of these scores is untouchable, and his closeness to Shostakovitch means these recordings are not only important but stunning with their impact.

"Banal and unoriginal I bought this book on a whim, having read a couple of rather mixed reviews. In that context, I was anticipating something entertaining and mildly stimulating. I was not expecting Isiah Berlin. But even against those less-than-demanding criteria, this book disappoints hugely.    Caitlin Moran entered journalism as a teenager, after winning competitions in national broadsheets including The Observer and The Times. Tellingly, these are omitted from this largely autobiographical book, which instead has her entering journalism at 16 when she went to work for Melody Maker. No doubt this version of history is more consistent with the edgy rise from working class obscurity she seeks to portray. I'm three years younger than Moran, and used to read her columns in my parents' copy of the Times, until I left home at 18, switched my allegiance to The Guardian, and lost track of her. So it was a strange experience to pick up this book and discover that, in terms of her attitudes and prose style, she seems to have become frozen in time as that precocious 16 year old - a kind of journalistic Dorian Gray. But what was endearing in a teenager is utterly infuriating - and oddly jarring- in a mature woman. The language is relentlessly mannered, with copious use of capitals and outdated slang from the 90s. This I could forgive if the book contained a single original idea, but the content is as banal, derivative and vacuous as the prose.     Take the chapter where she bemoans the lack of suitable female role models, and bizarrely juxtaposes Philip Roth with Demi Moore, Kim Cattrall and Madonna. This is simply baffling- comparing not so much apples and oranges as apples and donkeys. I don't even think she's trying to make the arguably valid but hardly original point that male writers tend towards the magisterial, zeitgeist-defining, century-spanning 'great novel', whereas women writers have tended to excel more at the (less esteemed) minute examination of the interior, domestic life. If she were, she might have found Margaret Attwood, Helen Simpson, or Anne Tyler more illuminating comparators than Moore et al. But by this stage you have started to form the impression that Moran's vision is entirely bounded by the confines of her media existence- a suspicion confirmed when you reach the Acknowledgements section and realise that, family aside, you recognise a good half of these names from the narrow world of broadsheet and TV journalism.    Ultimately, this is not a book about feminism at all- it's a not terribly interesting memoir with a spurious theme bolted on. Moran wants to validate her own preferences (burlesque clubs but not strip joints; Lady Gaga but not Katie Price), but she does not have the creativity or intellectual ability of, say, Camille Paglia, to do so convincingly. And speaking of Paglia, here's a funny thing. Only one feminist writer/thinker is namechecked in the entire book- Germaine Greer. If you are purporting to write a book about modern feminism, I'm not sure whether that speaks to arrogance, ignorance, or extreme laziness, but it's hardly impressive.    It could be argued that this book has some utility if it introduces WAG-obsessed young female readers of celebrity gossip magazines to a semblance of feminist ideas, in a language they'll readily identify with. But as a commentary on modern feminism for the mature, intelligent woman, it's a dead loss. If that's what you're looking for, give this a miss and try Natasha Walter, Maureen Dowd or Barbara Ehrenreich instead.",0

"Total Rip Off - don't waste your money! It's a shame you have to buy the album to get a couple of tracks that you may not already own, remaining Queen members trying to cash in on loyal fans, only a few seconds of Michael Jackson, god rest Freddie, I'm sure if he was still alive he would not have allowed this release.  It's just a greatest hits album with a couple of so called exclusive tracks, why could they not have released them as an EP, been a loyal Queen fan from the onset, rest assured I will never buy another Queen album again as I'm sure they will just be re-hashing some more old material and charging over the odds for it.",0

I really enjoyed it but it had a mix of good and bad points.<br />On a negative note, the monsters were quite unbelievable and the plot in general seemed a bit silly.<br />However, the acting was good and the film explored human nature in adversity in a very disturbing way.  It addressed themes of witchhunting/scapegoating and mass hysteria.<br />The ending was also very good and unexpected.<br />I can't say this was a great film as it seemed too far-fetched but I did really enjoy watching it.",0

"Informative and readable but.... I was looking forward to reading this book as I really liked `Kite Runner'. But I did not think A `Thousand Splendid Suns' was as strong as `Kite Runner'. The characters are well drawn, but I felt Hosseini does not understand women as well as he so fully understood and got inside the skin of the male characters of `Kite Runner' from childhood to adulthood. I feel the bitterness of the Afghan women, specially Miriam, but somehow I do not empathise with them. To me, their lives seem squalid rather than difficult and troubled.    The book was almost documentary, and for me was not as evocative as Kite Runner in portraying Afghanistan itself. It was as if the author concentrated too much on the story, which moves swiftly (too swiftly?) and never sags, but without giving the same amount of attention to the characters, which to me often lacked depth. And with so much emphasis on the terrible treatment of Afghan women by their menfolk and their society, which forms the bulk of the book, it is hard to accept that it is easy for a widow to remarry, as happens at the end. It seems an easy plot point to keep the story moving, But jars with everything that has gone before.      That said it is very readable and in many ways informative, although the political events have a `pasted in' feel and do not blend in as naturally as they should. And I would rather spend a day read this than much of the hyped up pulp on the market.",0

hilarious and underrated One of my favourite disney films! So easy to watch and the jokes are so funny. I'm 18 years old and have watched this relentlessly and I still don't get bored! Worth the buy,1
Not as good as I had hoped. Ron Howard film.  Jim Carrey in the lead role.  Christine Baranski as the love interest (before she ruined her face too much).  The omens were good.  What a shame that the film doesn't deliver.  I can't really put my finger on why either.  The town of Whoville is beautifully realised and the characters (except Baranski)are all made up to look like the Seuss drawings.  The film certainly looks the part.  Carrey plays the Grinch to manic perfection.  The film just doesn't seem to engage the viewer.  I saw it at the cinema with friends on its release and we all agreed that it seemed to drag.  I've watched it a couple of times since on DVD and I still get that feeling.  my kids aren't too fond of it either and they both like the Seuss books.  A disappointment.,0

The maps are worse as they dont label the streets and it is difficult to orient oneself, especially in a place like India. Secondly, I am finding omissions of really important places/sites from walking tours and the \\""""Do in One Day (or two)...\\"""" paragraphs. It seems to be change for the heck of it. Thirdly, LP mentions contact details for airlines in almost every city listed in the book.

I liked the first film because it was simple, fun and of a good(ish) quality.<br /><br />Retaliation is a mess of a film. Actors and Actresses are all capable people in this film. Script isn't too bad either. But its the action scenes that all seem complete rubbish.<br /><br />Special effects are ok, CGI overload, but its all good. The action scenes are all over the top unrealistic rubbish. First action scene seems to have no relevance to the film but its all too unbelievable even for an action / comic book film.<br /><br />SPOILER - first scene, is it really possible that no one saw the Joe's cutting the fence and strolling in to the camp even when it seemed very bright, next to a guard tower with lots of guards...... The whole films plays out like this....<br /><br />Over the top, unbelievable and unrealistic ... too much<br /><br />3D is ok. This film was not filmed in 3D, converted afterwards. Its not Avengers 3D quality, but its ok, not the best, not the worst.<br /><br />2D quality is very good for a bluray title, the DTS sound track is actually very impressive.

"Fast Diet It really works and is so easy, I have learnt i can deal with hunger, time will tell if my main reason for doing it will work though,brain health!",1
"Great for meat lovers but... Great diet for meat lovers! However if you are not a devoted carnivore you might find this diet difficult to stick to.<br />What  follows reflects my own experience and opinion of the diet, I am not too interested in the for or against Dukan battle.<br />First I'd like to say that Dukan is not the same as Atkins as some people suggest as Atkins allows/encourages fat meats, Dukan on the contrary forbids them, Dukan is a kind of very low fat Atkins + oat bran.<br />The diet is well planned in 4 phases, each phase being less restrictive than the preceding one, you definitely have to read the book fully before you start -if only to know what you can look forward to in the next phase!<br />I stuck to phase 1 (Attack)for 5 days and absolutely hated it as of day 3. Contrary to others I did not find the oat bran galette palatable at all, it is quite filling Ok but tasty, I don't think so. However my main problem was the lack of vegetables. Don't take me wrong, I am a carnivore but feeding on meat, eggs and fish only did not agree with me, I felt clogged, sluggish, weak -I am rather active- and bored, very very bored with the diet, actually longing to become a vegetarian! Still I stuck to it because it was a short term effort.<br />Weight loss 1.5kg and mostly water, yeah right!<br />Then started on phase 2 (cruise) which you are supposed to stick to until you reach your target weight. In this phase you alternate protein only days with veg/protein days. Stuck to it for about another week  and finally gave up because I found it difficult to fit in so many protein only days with children -back home after a week away- asking me why they should eat their vegetables when I did not. So pressure got me off tracks and quite happily so in a way as I hated protein only days anyway. Ok call it an excuse if you wish but really I was so relieved -both mentally and physically- to get back to protein/veg meals every day that it did not feel like a failure but a victory over something which did not agree with me at all. So some weight did come off (as it does with other diets anyway) but this diet was not for me. However if I had been a devoted carnivore, I would have loved it and it would have been a great way to lose weight as it is true you do not go hungry and the diet is well planned to help you reach your target weight and stay there provided you respect a few rules. Obviously if you go wild again you will put everything back on- again like any other diet.<br />So my conclusion:<br />Bad points: difficult to stick to unless you are really a devoted meat/egg/fish lover ( boredom, sluggishness, possible constipation in phase 1). The very low fat approach makes it healthier than Atkins but to what extent? Our body also needs fats and unless we eat fatty fish on a regular basis I suspect this might not be as healthy as it seems in the long run (+don't we need a variety of fats even if it is in moderation?)<br />Good points: I was not impressed by the weight loss in phase 1or even the first 2 weeks, however one great point was that the short time I was on the diet weaned me off sweet cravings and I did not miss alcohol at all. The other good point is that I now absolutely love my veg to a point I would never have anticipated -the power of frustration? So the diet has actually set me on the right track for a much healthier diet: sort of low carb (one cake a week ;-), low fat to a -reasonable- point, little alcohol and regular exercise which I was on before anyway: I liked the fact that Dukan 'prescribed' walking  as apart of his diet as I have been a convert for quite some time. I will also keep the idea of oat bran with yogurt as a healthy snack or breakfast and possibly one protein day a week when/if ever I feel up to it as he advises for phase 3 (stabilisation).<br />So not a bad experience after all even if this diet as a whole is not for me. Hope this helps some people to make up their minds as to whether or not they want to give this diet a try,good luck !",0
Three Stars Interesting like being able to do puzzles,0
"Compared to their old albums it's not so good. I would actually probably give this more of a 3.5 stars if I could. I have been listening to Walk off the Earth for years, I found them on YouTube and fell in love with their inventive ways of playing music, using their instruments - including their voices. Their videos are also incredible. However...this album seems too - for lack of a better word - 'easy' for them. The sound just isn't as 'complicated' as previous songs and albums. The trouble is that I so badly wanted to like this, that it's hard for me to accept that I feel a bit disappointed by it. Don't get me wrong, none of the songs are bad, they are quite good but as someone who has listened to them for so long I feel as though I am comparing to their older stuff, which is just so much more inventive. There's also a lot more 'autotuned' voices in their album which isn't right because all of their voices are so beautiful without the need for any computer intervention. You do get a taster of a few of these songs on their YouTube and it took me a few times listening to them for me to realise I did like them...usually I listen to them and love them right away so this should have been an indicator for whether or not I'd like the album. I'd say the songs with videos already are probably the best on the album. I also found them quite refreshing by not producing a mass of songs about love, but a lot of this album is focussed on love...and break up which also disappoints me.<br />Overall it's my least favourite album by them, as they don't seem like the same band in this album as they did in R.E.V.O but the songs aren't bad... I'm a bit fussy.",0

"Such a disappointment for a hardcore Justice fan Having seen Justice live on at least 5 occasions and being a big fan and proud owner of Cross and A Cross the Universe, I am disappointed to say that there is no such enjoyment associated with this album. I have been waiting for 3 or 4 years for a good Cross number 2 album, but here there is no Genesis, Waters of Nazareth, The Party, Phantom or even a Let There Be Light or DANCE. The songs sound like rehashed versions of DVNO with annoying tacky vocal and guitar riffs that make the whole album sound unfinished and low-quality.   Sure, Justice have changed and maybe now they appeal to a new fan-base; I'm sure this stuff has a target audience. However if the drop on Genesis or the raw unprocessed dirty bass of Waters of Nazareth made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, then please steer away from this. I will only listen to it once before I listen to Cross again and pretend that Justice are still like that.",0
"Room for Improvement This may be a slightly earlier edition that the 2006 one, but from what I could tell much of the content is the same.  Of course the layout and use of colour in the later edition is a vast improvement, but my comments here will principally apply to both editions as far as I can tell.<br /><br />On the plus side :<br />1,  The authors do make attempts to categorise the vocabulary into useful topics and concepts.  Students can therefore select chapters which are either relevant to their present study or are of interest to them personally.<br />2.  What's more, many of the model sentences have the ring of authentic English about them and so students wouldn't sound foreign if they used them directly from the book.<br />3.  Attempts have been made to make the student's first encounters with vocabulary more inviting through the use of articles, mini dialogues, a few pictures etc.<br />4.  There is a fairly good range of (mainly) controlled practice activities to familiarise students with the meaning, word class, etc. of the vocabulary items in question.<br /><br />On the negative side :<br />1.  There is far too much listing of vocabulary with accompanying definition in the presentation stage.  Not only is this off-putting for all but the most resolute student, but it also speaks of sheer laziness on the part of the authors.  There are many many ways to enliven new vocabulary and more importantly get students involved right from the word go.  Far too often I've worked through a section wondering whether I wasn't just looking at some glorified thesaurus and dictionary dressed up to look like a study book.<br />2.  It's ironic that although the authors mention register they have very little regard for when and where certain types of vocabulary could be used - and, more importantly, - what sort of individual would use certain of the &#34;informal&#34; language chosen by the authors.  Personally, I find expressions like &#34;living from hand to mouth&#34; (&#34;scrimp and save&#34; not mentioned) and &#34;she'll get over it&#34; (referring to health) rather idiotic - the sort of thing that would lower my estimation of whoever was saying them and make me cringe if spoken by a non-native speaker.  All this is reminiscent of the worst from the otherwise excellent (though undoubtedly &#34;best ideas plundered from my past DELTA/DipTEFL students&#34;) Headway series (eg. &#34;That's corny&#34;.  &#34;Tell me about it&#34; ad nauseum). Especially at proficiency level students really ought to be encouraged to be aware of at least 4 degrees of register, AND warned about certain words, phrases and structures. Nuances of meaning are also frequently overlooked in this book.  Although there is some work on collocations, I would have preferred more and for it to form part of nearly every unit.<br />3.  There seems to be little purpose to some of the units except the possible recognition and recitation of set words.  Consequently, on these occasions, students might well lack confidence in actually integrating the vocabulary into their own use and practising it in the real world.  Now that really is an indictment of these Cambridge authors...Will I get a job as a Cambridge consultant? Probably not.

"Space stooges As this film amply demonstrates, Alex Garland is a man of ideas. Sacrifice, hope (and hopelessness), redemption, salvation, and all their little friends: he trots out the lot. What he does not trot out is characterization, anything resembling actual human speech to serve as dialogue, or a plot that can even chin itself to the \\""""sketchy\\"""" level. Director Danny Boyle tries to cover by snowing us with reams of F/X shots and camera trickery (most notably in the case of one character who insists on being blurry-- yes!), and Underworld and John Murphy, obviously looking at a much better film during the scoring process, serve up some lovely, high-flying, heroic music. But what \\""""Sunshine\\"""" boils down to (with apologies for any punnery that might bring to mind) is a group of supposedly professional, competent men and women acting utterly according to the coldhearted, melodramatic whims of a bad writer. The result is a mishmash of special effects and the squandering of a good cast and beautiful music. My advice to those buying or renting the DVD: skip the film itself and watch the deleted scenes, which offer a few snippets of lyrical characterization and a nice fleshing-out of the finale (if not the ending scene). Then take the time you've saved and watch something more worthwhile.",0
Five Stars Excellent purchase,1

"not too impressed. I had heard a lot about this band before buying the cd.  Unfortunately after buy it I was a bit disappointed.  I am not saying they are particularly bad, but we do not have another Muse, Kasabian or Coldplay here.  Not even another Peace, Frightened Rabbit or Foals.  Not really my cup of tea I'm afraid.  Full of soaring harmonies that quite frankly get on my nerves after a bit.  I was going to see them on their up-coming tour later this year, but now I do not think I will bother.",0
"Rubbish DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS APP! I really don't recommend this app as it doesn't actually work! I could open it easily, but once i had chosen a video to watch and clicked on it, it shut down. It doesn't even deserve one star!",0
not worth the money I had the trail version of this and liked it so I paid over &Acirc;&pound;10 for this and it says does not support 3D so for that money all it done was really change the icons and a few other little changes even tho its called next launcher 3D it don't support 3D .,0

Five Stars Excellent. Very enjoyable.,1
Average The book has a good start - pretty good ending but I could not care less for everything else in between. I wish we could read more about the guy character's obsession with the former rock star - I think that was a promising storyline but the switch to the life of the rock star made the story less interesting for me as Hornby did not have anything to say surprising or interesting about his life but just devoted pages to describe his failed and uninteresting relationships.,0
"good but takes up to 25 minutes to load Play this  game a lot when I first got it really good game, after a few weeks of playing the game it started to load up slowly up to 25 minutes to get on the game and same again after battles another 25 minutes, nearly an hour to get on and 1 battle not good giving it another week or so and deleting if not fixed",0

don't bother BORING Never played a game before where I have forced myself to finish! The story line was poor and the constant back and forth was tedious. The hidden object scenes were awful. The back button was constantly on items you needed. Much better games out there for less money. Ending was left open for sequel but I won't bother. Didn't leave me wanting more.,0
"bitter disappointment firstly, im going to start by saying that I realise many fans will not agree with this review however I think many others will agree with me; ive refrained from reviewing it since I bought it, thinking that it will grow on me but it is actually now to the point where i cant listen to it without getting annoyed and bitterly disappointed.    i have been a fan of sylosis since they released the casting shadows EP which i randomly bought from hmv for £6 when it came out, and it was well worth it and they became my new favourite band. The Supreme Oppressor EP was also awesome; and then we had Conclusion of An Age debut which was and still is simply brilliant.  ive also seen them live and know they can cut it.  So they had a lot to live up to with this new one.    The problem for me is the vocals by Josh; I read recently, although he may have been mis-quoted, but the jist of it was that he had said that Conclusion of an Age was 'kiddie metal' and this new album would be proper metal and just how he visioned sylosis to be. now, i thought this was a bit offensive towards their many fans, sort of labelling their fans as lightweight metallers / bullet for my valentine lovers or something (which is fine if you like BFMV!!)  So Jamie quits (or gets asked to leave i hear) and Josh takes up the vocals. very bad move in my opinion.  this new album has been ruined by monotonous one dimensional grunts which actually sound like a kid trying too hard to sound 'metal'.   sylosis is now the 'josh middleton project' which is fine if the tunes (and vocals) were backing it up. he may aswell have re-recorded conclusion of an age but with himself grunting over the top. A vocalist is meant to add another layer to the music, to bring energy and emotion to it; even full on death metal growlers can do that, im not writing this as a so called 'kiddie metaller' that he thinks his fans may be.  i appreciate the fine art of metal and love the more heavier bands like desecration and deicide (check out these bands latest releases). i just think his vocal style is very below average and does not do the music any favours at all. Josh is clearly a very talented guy/musician/guitarist but i think he should re-consider the fact that he cant be great at everything and should get a new vocalist in to do the band justice and he should concentrate on the killer music he writes.     the music on edge of the earth is brilliant (that alone gets 5stars), its not a million miles away from Conclusion.., but stick his vocals to it and its quite painful to listen to. it hasnt grown on me at all. there is also too much filler on there (empyreal pt2 - whats all that about?!!)  i still listen to all their other releases regularly; i had such high hopes for this new one but im afraid, with the new vocals, its so off the mark its unreal.  if another few months of listening changes my mind I will eat my own hat with my head still in it but i know its not gonna happen.   for those of you as gutted as me, and anyone who appreciates the fine art of metal - you must check out Allegaeon and their album Fragments of Form and Function - now this is simply brilliant, my album of 2010/2011 so far; it came out last July/August and I cant believe they arent getting recognition for it. its simply awesome metal, the riffs, the technical ability, the musicianship, the songs are amazing; every track is a winner and the vocals are good!!",0

"Clever story but too much literary posing I'm less excited about this novel than the average reader. Sure it is a clever story and at times quite gripping. But there is something in the telling that makes me wonder if the author hasn't had an overdose of literary writing classes. Each of the different voices used to tell the story are highly reminiscent of other classic literary characters, reminding me of my school days when I was instructed to write a piece \\""""in the voice of x\\"""".",0

BORING AND UNINSPIRED! If anyone thinks this is really good then they can't have listened to much other stuff. There are no songs I would listen to more than once. Some of their other stuff is good but definetly not this S hit. It's missing origionality. They've just copied Oasis like so many bands. Oasis are so much better. Where's the excitment you would get from Marilyn Manson or even Eminem (although he's rap) and the passion every other big band has. Also the songs have rubbish and dull meanings. I honestly don't think that this is a good album and is very over-rated.,0

"Why? I struggled a bit to decide the rating for this book. I am a fan of the series and of the characters Collins has created, but I can't help but feel disappointed with the ending to the trilogy. As I assume you have read the book or its prequels, at least, to be here then I will continue without laying out the story as many others have so successfully done. (I warn you now there may be a few spoilers).  One of the trilogy's greatest strengths has always been the character of Katniss and her 'real-ness'. Unlike certain other heroines of modern literature, she wasn't afraid to speak her mind and to act true to form, even if it results in a negative outcome or one the onlooker/reader wouldn't necessarily have pictured. She was strong, brave and we as readers respected that, we admired her strength of mind as well as her physical talents. However, since the end of her second games and the periods of extended sedation/hospitalisation (often for her 'own good'...) I've found these aspects of her character that I adored to be majorly lacking. Why at the climax did Katniss fade from the resolution into yet another period of sedation where she refuses to acknowledge the real world and then recalls the events that have passed in an all too short flashback. Collins has carried out this technique before,and uses it again, but surely it shouldn't have been used at the end, the moment which Katniss the Mockingjay should claim, not fall away from.  Maybe I've missed the point here, it really did feel like Katniss had been worn down by her experiences and this resulted in a much more hollow shell of a person as a main character. If this defeatism was the intended impression and end message that Collins intended the ending of the trilogy to have then it is this that I have a problem with after reading a series so dedicated to its exact opposite.  What also irked me was the way this climax of the story and all the major events in the novels seemed more than a little bit rushed. The ending really wasn't given the time it deserved and nor were the endings for other major characters, notably Gale and Peeta. The final twist in the storyline, delivered by Snow, was almost half-explained but then swift actions had to be summed up by yet another breakdown of events that Katniss had missed (this a common theme in the trilogy) and this added confusion to the events and what exactly Katniss was planning, I was even confused about her mindset and plans for the action she carried out, particularly regarding Coin. The epilogue too, in light of the 'new' Katniss, just seemed sad...for lack of better words. Her attitude to life quite a way down the line seemed to capture the new defeatist Katniss, worn down by the Capitol and not the fighter or the Mockingjay that her figure previous inspired. Perhaps I could understand if there was a title to follow, but as far as I'm aware this is not the case.  By no means, having said all this, is 'Mockingjay' a bad book, the storyline is interesting, the character of Katniss works true to form, or at least recently established form for the majority of the book and the secondary main characters are well written and more than believable. However unfortunately 'Mockingjay' does fall short against it's two predecessors and to the expectations that they, and the majority of this book even, promised.",0

"One of my favorite series ever! Okay, this book was PERFECT. JUST PERFECT. That is the single best word to describe it.<br /><br />In each book one of my absolute favorite elements has been the introduction of the gods. In this book I must say it was Hestia. Goddess of the hearth - you always forget about her, but to me it strikes a chord, as home has always been the most important thing to me. So her character to me was a beautiful addition that really made you think. I was surprised because usually in all mythology Persephone is my favorite, but Riordan's adaptation of her wasn't that amazing to me.<br /><br />So much action. It's amazing. When you think about it, like 200 or so of the 250 pages is just the battle. Or that's what it feels like. It goes on and on but it NEVER GETS TIRING. It was beautifully constructed. And while it did get a *little* bit corny after a while that every x pages a new reinforcement would appear, it was awesome because all of the characters came back. And if they had all been there from the beginning, in the end no one would have gotten the right amount of attention.<br /><br />What scene was amazing to me? Just every every every single bit of it. Seriously, thinking back, it was just completely solid. Each scene was an absolute page turner and added to the story. I just couldn't read fast enough. I must admit, if they do ever get to a movie of this book, it will be completely and totally epic. I already realized that when Percy bathes in the River Styx, and the battle following that. That was SO FREAKING AWESOME. The images in my head, gah, it makes me wish I could work in the movie industry or something. And just after that, all the fight scenes... amazing.<br /><br />The ending just had me flailing. Flailing and flailing. Percy/Annabeth is PERFECT. I just love their relationship. I love the teasing and the .. the... adorable cuteness of it all xD Especially when Percy tries to confess. That was just a perfect perfect scene. Seriously.<br /><br />This book was absolutely perfect, the best book in the series. My heart is totally sold to this fandom right now. And I will be continuing with The Heroes of Olympus very very soon.<br /><br />Recommended for: fans of Percy Jackson and Harry Potter.olutely perfect, the best book in the series.

"Interesting but disappointing. I wasn't planning on buying this album as I was suitably unimpressed by the track \\""""Born This Way\\"""". I just didn't get the hype about it, I thought it was a bit cheesy really. However after watching Lady Gaga's performance at Radio One's One Big Weekend I was intrigued. I really enjoyed a couple of her more emotional songs so decided to pre-order the album.  On it's arrival, I did actually play the whole album through. Some songs stuck in my mind more than others. On the whole, there were no songs that really grated on my nerves but I just wasn't that impressed. I am listening to the album as I type and it's definitely a different Lady Gaga.  My favourite songs are; Born This Way (despite what I said earlier!), Marry The Night, Judas, You and I, The Edge of Glory and Highway Unicorn (Road to Love). Maybe I am just old and boring (at 22) but I just don't get some of the other songs. To me, Hair is a very cheesy pop song aimed at teenagers...  I have Lady Gaga's previous albums and this one is a bit different although still Lady Gaga-ish. At the moment, I am not entirely overly impressed with the album but maybe a few more listens will change that. I am definitely not \\""""a little monster\\"""" and I wonder if this slight change in sound will be received well or not.",0

"Dismal and depressing Take my advice and give all of this trilogy a miss!  Why?  Because although it starts well, has strong characters, some really big and clever ideas, and is quite thoughtful, I found it also to be hugely depressing.<br /><br />Along the way, there is much to admire, and the fact that I got to the end of a three book trilogy says much for its ability to intrigue, fascinate and hold the attention.  However the `Dark' in the title is not to be ignored, because for me, this trilogy got darker and darker as it went along, and there were many occasions in the third book when I nearly gave up on the whole thing.<br /><br />Finally I did persevere to the end, as I needed to know how it finished, but I found parts of book 3 to be very unsettling, deeply dismal, and disturbing. Also, for me, some of the plot turns in the third book were just too contrived to be believable.<br /><br />On reflection, I really wish I had never started this. I need a stiff drink, and I don't drink!",0
"Best puzzle game available The Room 1&amp;2 Give great graphics and a slight twist on the usual 'escape' puzzle games, with a good balance of difficulty to make this a great game to pass time, definitely worth the small price.

"Strange little book I bought this book as I work in one of the places mentioned in it and was wondering what sort of silly questions I would have to answer from members of the public after it was published. If I was Stephanie Meyer I would be sueing the socks off Deborah Harkness,who should incidentally, stick to writing history books or guides to places of interest in Oxford.  Very very slow start, felt absolutely no empathy for the key character, then it descended into self gratification. I really felt that the writer has sadly,never fallen truly in love because she doesn't know what it feels like, she also has no idea of what physical pain feels like, she's kind of sado-machocistic almost enjoying the ruin of her key character's body.  She has obviously researched witchcraft a great deal and all sorts of people will be trying dangerous desperate things and dabbling in things they really shouldn't because of her book.  I will not be wasting my money buying the next two books.",0
"Five Stars Very good, poetic story!",1
"But remember: This is not a reputable grammar source. While this may be a wonderfully humorous book, it still cannot compete with the major grammar resources for writers and editors. I realize Ms Truss is a writer, and her bio does state that she was also an editor (though, it does not state for how long or how successful she was). However, as the major, glaring, punctuational error on the front cover proves, even writers need editors . . . and apparently, so do editors. <br />I am frustrated with the number of writers who quote \\""""Eat Shoots and Leaves\\"""" as an argument for why they can stick a comma any darn place they please. This book does quote some of the same rules I find in the reputable sources; however, it conflicts in others. It looks as though Ms Truss was tired of the editors telling her to remove her commas and decided to write a book to back up her own argument.<br />I would not recommend this book unless, perhaps, you want a laugh. I would never dishonor the valid resource books I own by placing this on the same shelf.",0

Husband left me after buying this film. After 38 years of Marriage to my husband Paul he finally let me purchase another film that had Brad Pitt in a starring role.<br /><br />The last time Paul allowed me to watch Mr. And Mrs Smith I borrowed the ten year old neighbour's air rifle and shot 4 of the local hoodied gentleman who tend to loiter outside the spar.<br /><br />My yorkshire terrier dog Trixy no longer has to take a crap on the pavement next to them in fear as they have sinced mooved to the Tesco-Extra due to my vigalanty act.<br /><br />Paul was very annoyed at this act ... Not at the shooting but as the Brad Pitt moovie inspired me to take spanish salsa classes where I met a 22 year old waiter named Rodrigo.<br /><br />Rodrigo and I spent a intimate 25 minute session in the disabeld toilets after Salsa class. Paul only found out as  my hip went out of place as Rodrigo and I atempted to reverse cowgirl on the paper towel box.<br /><br />Paul and I have since reconciled and he even manged to run over Rodrigos foot in Marks and spencers car park yesterday in his new mobility scooter.<br /><br />World war Z has also helped our marriage futher as we can both admire Brad pitts enthusiam without resorting to sex with younger parters or shooting  hooligans. Instead Paul and I now regugarly visit our local cinema togther to watch various films ...we rekindle our love life every Sunday with a watch of World War Z and half a pack of  vigara pills from Boots .<br /><br />4 stars for an excellent film.,1

"Better than I expected from a band I find very hard to enjoy Metallica is a band that I just don't get.  Their music is plodding, overlong and with little variation.  The cloak of none more black darkness they like to project is completely unconvincing.  Also their lyrics are weak and sung by a singer who doesn't have much of a voice.  Their metallic churn just doesn't hit me in the gut.  I've often wondered why people prefer them to Megadeth or Tool who are making much more impressive and varied music from the same heavy metal ballpark.<br /><br />It was surprising though that I liked it more than I expected when I listened to it for this review (inspired by rewatching the Classic Albums making of documentary).  Although it's still plodding etc I heard a bit more merit in their music than I've ever heard before.<br /><br />1. Enter Sandman (7 out of 10 stars)<br />It's got a good heavy riff and the light/night lyric is a good pop hook.<br /><br />2. Sad But True (7 stars)<br />Nothing great but oddly tuneful, if a tad overlong.<br /><br />3. Holier Than Thou (5 stars)<br />It's not bad but it's very unremarkable.  The song could be deleted and no one would notice.<br /><br />4. The Unforgiven (6 stars)<br />Competent metal ballad.  I've heard better but then again I've heard much worse.<br /><br />5. Wherever I May Roam (7 stars)<br />The heaviest song on the album.  Lyrically a bit more involved and honest sounding, although still hardly full of great lines.<br /><br />6. Don't Tread On Me (7 stars)<br />More melodic than usual.  Also the lyrics are quite good.<br /><br />7. Through The Never (5 stars)<br />Generic Metallica churn.<br /><br />8. Nothing Else Matters (5 stars)<br />Another ballad.  A bit bland.<br /><br />9. Of Wolf And Man (7 stars)<br />A more interesting and memorable song with a more involved vocal performance.<br /><br />10. The God That Failed (5 stars)<br />By numbers.  Neither adds or subtracts from the album.<br /><br />11. My Friend Of Misery (2 stars)<br />Has an atmospheric opening guitar part that quickly gets submerged in the standard metal sound.  Shame.  It's a more subdued song, almost mid-tempo.  Really outstays its welcome and becomes very boring and feels endless.<br /><br />12. The Struggle Within (4 stars)<br />Makes a lot of noise but nothing interesting is happening.  Pretty tiresome but at least it's fairly short.<br /><br />The album is overlong at 62 minutes.  I suggest removing tracks 3, 7, 11 and 12 to make it into a less bloated eight song 44 minute album.<br /><br />Also I like to make EP playlists out of some albums on my iPod.  Tracks 1, 2, 5 and 9 made the cut.",0

"For the technogeek There were some enjoyable bits, but too much of it focuses on technological details which bored me to death. This probably was covered more than the plot itself. The book would have been more lively with most of this detail cropped out. I found the end very depressing. :'(",0
"This'll keep you guessing 'til the end! David Twohys Perfect Getaway jumps straight in with both feet from the first scenes and really never stops with Steve Zahn and Mira Jovovich ( who play Cliff & Cydney) who head-off to Hawaii on honeymoon.They hire everything they need and make for the trail which will lead them to the isolated beaches on one of the small islands stopping to give another young couple - Kale and Cleo,a lift before making excuses to \\""""jettison them\\"""" for someone else to help. When they later coincidentally meet-up at an off-the-track pool trouble brews but is stopped by the intervention of Nick (Timothy Olyphant) who has just introduced himself to our frightened friends - frightened because they have just become aware of a Killer Couple being hunted on a nearby island after butchering a pair of young tourists.The 3 along with Nicks long suffering girlfriend Gina agree to stick together for the remainder of their trek to the beaches a couple of miles furthe on.I'll say no further to save spoiling the remainder except in the second half of the film the twists and turns increase until it's hard to know who's really who?",0
"A good record, but firmly eclipsed by Live Rust I've been listening to the excellent Live Rust (which shares a number of common tracks with this album, albeit differently produced) for almost fifteen years, but only got around to picking this up a month or two back. It's fine, but the elements that it shares with Live Rust are better (at least in my opinion…) without the overdubs.<br /><br />If you're discovering Neil Young, there are better studio albums to buy. And did I mention that Live Rust's excellent…?",0

Works if you stick at it! I used the book mainly for the weight loss section as like most people I thought it was too good to be true.<br />I'm 21 years old and a little overweight for my age.

"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator-A review by Malvika Arora age 10 Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is a scary awesome book. The book carries on from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The Characters are the same as in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, Charlie, his family and Willy Wonka. The first half of the story is set in space the second half is set in the Chocolate Factory. Out in space there are monsters to deal with and back in the Chocolate factory the Grandparents get in trouble when they get greedy. They has really weird adventures because they could fit  a bed in a Glass Elevator. I would recommend it to my friends.",0
"Christmas gift fail! I purchased this movie as a Christmas gift for my brother directly from his Amazon.co.uk wish list. It was supposed to be a Blu-ray that included 3D. As I prepared to make my purchase, I discovered that the blu-ray was not available however it was available through other sellers. Since substitutes were offered by Amazon, through his wish list I assumed, even though they were from &#34;other sellers&#34; it would be the exact same copy he desired from his list. I found a seller in which to purchase the Blu-ray from then placed my order. The shipment was originally estimated to be late with an expected arrival date in January but much to my surprise it arrived before Christmas so I was very happy about that. Unfortunately upon speaking with my brother, I was extremely disappointed to find out the Blu-ray that was shipped to him was only a Blu-ray, it was not 3D at all. Be wary when purchasing from other sellers listed by Amazon...they are NOT apples for apples!",0
"Let down by poor examples This book is jam-packed with useful guidance and information. Unfortunately, the examples given are both few in number and rather obscure, which is as surprising as it is disappointing, considering that the book is over 800 pages long. Nevertheless, some of the tips given are clear enough, even without the benefit of accompanying code excerpts. For example, the section on using Procedure Description Langauege to design programs is one of the best that I have seen on the subject. The stuff on using random patterns in testing was also a real eye-opener.    This book is certainly not a reference text but I'm sure everybody can take a few pointers from it to spruce up their programming.",0
"The Dark Side of the Moon This low budget film is a gentle and touching exploration of what it is to be human. Two years before he is due to return to Earth from the dark side of the moon Sam Bell begins to suffer hallucinations. He has spent the last three years alone, co-ordinating a mining operation. With significant references to 2001: A Space Odyssey, Silent Running and Blade Runner this is an intelligent examination of isolation, identity and the basic human need to belong.",1

"Everybody has something to hide in this Broken City There are some solid acting performances in this contemporary noir drama about political corruption in New York. Russell Crowe is suitably menacing as Mayor Hostetler ruthlessly plotting to stay in office, and using former cop turned private investigator Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) to spy on his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who he suspects is having an affair. It is election time and everybody is on the edge since everybody has something to hide. However, despite the stunning cinematography giving the film a sense of style and quality, the screenplay has a formulaic quality resulting in a predictable narrative. The storytelling lacks the vibrancy one would associate with modern politics and perhaps if the movie had been set in the mid-20th century the film would have a greater authenticity. I am pleased to have watched it but will not be doing so again.",0

"A Missed Opportunity Being such a huge fan of DD, and having very much enjoyed the band biography \\""""Notorious\\"""", (and even Andy Taylor's biography), I was really looking forward to reading John's memoirs. Unfortunately, this book is such a huge let-down. It feels rushed and more like a first draft of a future biography than a finished book. Apart from writing about his childhood and early Duran Duran in somewhat deeper detail, the entire second period of Duran and his own life, from the end of the 80s up to the present day, is squeezed into a few speeding chapters.<br />Not even one full paragraph was spent on albums like \\""""Big Thing\\"""" or \\""""Liberty\\""""..Even the band's big reunion and its accompanying album \\""""Astronaut\\"""" were discribed hastily and with no real details. The same goes for the group's last two albums...So basically, i found out nothing that i hadn't already known. Really, a missed opportunity...",0

"Proceed with caution if you're looking for self help techniques. In a nutshell: If your mother was stressed-out or otherwise in some kind of unhappy/angry/fraught/traumatic state when she was pregnant with you, or your parents (if together) were often violently arguing, and then once you were born you were deprived of any love/affection/encouragement/support, then sorry, but the die has been cast and you will have an unhappy life, always be a failure, never succeed at anything you want to do, no matter how intelligent you are or what good ideas you may have. Something will always get in the way or otherwise prevent it from happening.     If you try a plethora of self-help and positive thinking techniques/affirmations, whatever, you will merely be at war with yourself and suffer dreadful anxiety as a result.   In fact, he mentions a movie to illustrate his point, whereby a gifted pianist, trying to overcome the deep-rooted fears put there by his over-protective father (victim of Holocaust) that he would only be safe if he never strayed far from home, the pianist managed to travel the world, presumably fears overcome with positive thought, succeeded in giving the performance of his life, only to go insane immedietely afterwards and never recover, because, according to Lipton, he had dared to try and overcome the negative 'programming' laid down in his mind since birth.     So, in spite of the talk about cells being affected by thought, he states that once any bad, early, instructions were fed into you, (example: you're worthless/never amount to anything/you're not loved, etc) then sorry, but the damage is now done, you're beyond hope and doomed to have a traumatic, unhappy life and nothing you can do about it. Positive affirmations won't work because nothing reaches the subconsious, not even any self-help techniques you may try - oh, except for one thing! - And that is something that has been 'invented' by his friend, but you've got to go and buy his friend's book to find out how that works. Then you will have to sign-up for one ofhis friend's courses because Lipton points out that the book alone won't be enough.     The book in question is 'Psych-K' and the bad reviews for it seem to say it all!     So, to sum up, what Lipton appears to be doing, apart from repeat the view that thought can affect cells (hardly a new concept nowadays) is to sell you the idea that if you were already unfortunate enough to have been neglected/abused/starved of love & affection, always put down or otherwise criticised/blamed, you are doomed, and the only technique that can 'save' you is what his friend is going to tell you about in his book, but then, really you have got to attend his expensive courses as you really cannot do it yourself!     This seems to me to be yet another excercise in some author trying to cash-in on people desperately looking for ways to improve their lives.     Lipton mentions much in the way of truth, but then I don't need him to tell me about the fact that pharmaceutical companies are among the richest organisations in the world, and that prescription drugs are big business for those behind them (doctors in pockets of drug companies, etc) dangers of medically-prescribed drugs, etc, etc, I would have thought that most people are perfectly capable of working that out for themselves, it doesn't take a genuis to see all this if you only stand back and look at how the 'system' works, (or rather doesn't work) surely most of us can see quite plainly what a racket it all is, (invent names for variations in personality, create a drug for it, and so on, it's called the medicalisation of normality) Lipton says all this too, and I agree, but then I already worked it out for myself, I didn't need to buy a book just to see the author agree with me; what Lipton does is say all this, which is true, and he explains the damage that could have been done to anyone through bad parentling or traumatic early experiences, promises to tell you what you can do about it, but then goes on to say that actually youcan't do anything about it, but that it can teach you not to do the same to any kids you may have, to give them a chance of having a good life, but you can't alter what damage may have been done to you, unless for the one thing that may help - his friend's 'Psych-K' techniques.     Sorry for writing a negative review, I would much rather say something good if it warrants it, and I so much wanted to feel positive about this book. I had to wait until I got to the epilogue before Lipton even mentioned anything that could be done to help people already damaged, and then it was only to try and sell his friend's book and get people signed-up for the course.     Really, if you're looking for ways to overcome inner self-sabotaging problems, you'll be better off buying a good book on Energy Pyschology, EFT techniques, (Emotional Freedom Techniques) though avoid Carol Look's book unless you already know all about EFT, as her book presupposes that you know exactly where to tap and if you have not learnt about it first, hers is not a good book to start with.     As for the book being reviewed here, (Biology of Belief) starts promising but ends up disappointing. You could even feel very depressed, thinking you were going to find answers, only to be told you're actually beyond help.     I can recommend \\""""You Can Heal Your Life\\"""", and \\""""I Can Do It\\"""", both by Louise Hay, far more positive and hopeful and helpful, and the latter comes with a very good CD too.    Another early book on similar lines to Lipton's, though may be difficult to obtain now, is \\""""The Unknown Spirit\\"""" by Jean Charon. It was one of the first books I read on these kind of metaphysical matters, and is very interesting, though there is no mention of anyone being damaged or beyond help, it is mainly about the nature of 'everything, and how mind, spirit, and matter are all intertwined and how the electrons may contain more than we realise.",0

"You may blush whilst reading this! Evocative of time and place though Amy Tan's Vally of Amazement maps the lives of three generations of women connected by blood and history-and the mystery of an evocative painting.<br /><br />She takes us on a journey through the dazzling world of courtesans in turn-of -the -century Shanghai, a remote Chinese mountain village, and the rough-hewn streets of nineteenth-century San Francisco.<br /><br />This is a booktrailer’s dream in one way  - the setting and the insight into the world of the Chinese courtesan. It evokes the atmosphere of bustling Shanghai at the turn of the century and grips from the start. The novel is quite long yes, but the descriptions of the tea parties and the courtesan’s life really are quite fascinating as you imagine what is going on outside of the courtesan’s house amidst the events of Shanghai & San Francisco from 1890s to the 1930s.<br /><br />This was a world not explored in the booktrail before and it was quite an eye opener  (in more ways than one! ahem) despite being a bit too long  but the story flows well and events build up so there are only few moments where you  are resting from the action so to speak.<br /><br />The nineteenth century settings are the real star of the show with San Francisco and Shanghai really coming into their own both before and leading up WW1 and the second. It is very graphic in places however - both descriptions of sex and the goings on within the courtesan world are, well, rather overdone? There are a lot of words for certain body parts used....<br /><br />Amy Tan is a gifted writer however and I was very pleased to have read such a book about female relationships and this courtesan world. Can’t say the characters are particularly likable and would they really have made the decisions they did with such ease? Don’t know - but the novel stands with the beautiful writing - I felt as if I’m still blushing now though months after reading it ! hehe",0

"Purely made for your cash with no love or care put into the script. A very slight film which is both unoriginal and uninteresting but is fine as background noise (perfect for a plane journey for example). The CGI is good and the sets and costumes work but the storyline is pure weak videogame structure with gaining new weapons and a final boss. None of the characters have any real arcs, and Bill Nighy is little more than a cameo. There is one insulting scene at the end when the hero suddenly kisses Rosamund Pike. It's stupid because they have had no previous romantic scenes as all the dialogue between the two is purely exposition. If anything Rosamund Pike and Toby Kebbel were the logical choice to have a romantic sub-plot.<br />The script is horrible and written by a five year old while making loads of mistakes on a very basic script writing level. It is also clearly a first draft that has been rushed into production without any thought, care or love put into it.<br />All the actors appear like they would rather be doing something else apart from Toby Kebbel who at least appears to put in some effort and should have had a bigger part (a clever script would make him the lead and Worthington an Obi Wan Kenobi figure).<br />Decent visuals but simply awful script means you should only watch this on an airplane or when you just want dumb action scenes.<br />The most insulting thing is that this was clearly made not for telling a good story but just for making money. These are classic narratives and characters written hundreds of years ago. The hard work of coming up with characters and narratives was already done for the studio but they still mess it up. It's hard to imagine how someone could mess up such a timeless myth that has endured for centuries but the studio do with this heap of rubbish.",0

All three female characters were very similar and I had to keep checking who was narrating at the time and similarly it seemed that Scott/Jason and Tom were the same person!  All were rather unpleasant people; I wouldn't like to meet them and felt nothing for them.<br /><br />I like a book to linger with me for days or weeks after I have read it, to really touch me or grip me.

"Slightly Disappointing I absolutely loved Howard's first album, and I never tire of hearing it. However, although I like it, I am a bit disappointed with this new album. For me, there are only 2 or 3 tracks at a stretch that seem memorable and stand out a bit. All of the others fade into one and honestly, most of it just sounds the same. His voice is beautiful, and I still enjoy listening to this album but the same instruments seem to be used in every track to create a dark and heavy atmosphere, always accompanied by murmured, melancholy lyrics. Maybe I just need to listen to it more and I hope I'll get more into it, as I desperately loved his first album. Overall, if you are an absolute manic fan then by all means buy this album, but otherwise I'd say it's not worth a buy unless you listen to the tracks on Youtube or Spotify first to see if you like this newer material.",0

"Disappointing as could have been one helluva great yarn As a huge SK fan for nearly 30 years, it saddens me to have to give this novel such a poor review.  I was so excited on first buying it as I thought King, once again, had come up with a fantastic and totally original storyline.  Being a bit of a Kennedy fan too (I'd just finished reading around 3 or 4 books on the Kennedy clan and the assassination) I was intrigued to find out how the story would pan out and whether, in a fictional sense, JFK would in fact be saved from his tragic fate by a time traveller from our current era. What a brilliant storyline!  How much fun can Mr King have with this I thought.  Regrettably it seemed like not much fun at all, which I still can't understand as it was such an enormously appealing fat juicy storyline just waiting to be exploited to the max by the likes of SK. It got off to a good start ... SK's seductively familiar voice luring me into a topsy turvy world of time travel and the promise of weird and wonderful things to come ... and then, vamoosh, that voice seemed to disappear and got replaced by some dowdy, starry eyed romantic who seems hell  bent on introducing the reader to all the intricacies of what it's like working in a school and putting on a play.  Where did the storyline go?  I have no idea and, after persevering for another few chapters I reluctantly abandoned the book completely ... something I've never done before with SK.  It's interesting however that my sister, another big SK fan, loved it ... and my brother, who's only ever read a couple of SK, rates it as one of the best books he's ever read!<br /><br />Perhaps I've missed something on this one.

And like a lot of folk it was THAT appearance at Glastonbury (with The Boss) that made me cry out WOW who are these guys?? But alas, as with the last album (59 Sound not included) there is something slightly amiss here. I actually think its something quite simple, because they strike me as a band who will always be good to see live, but their albums could turn out to kinda be a damp squib. What is missing is b*lls (if you catch my drift). This album needs to be returned to the studio and remixed with a huge dose of oommph to bring it alive! Given a big, wall of sound, Phil Spector-esque injection, it could be great. Its just that right now it seems to fall short on that huge, (dare I say it?) Bruce Springsteen anthemic sound. Is anyone else feeling that? Its not that the songs are overly weak, its just the sound of it that is. I almost feel I could do it myself (I couldnt, but Im making a point here) it would take that little to fix it. Maybe next time they will give it a bit more production welly, but at the moment its a bang, rather than a wallop.",0

"A good set up, but a rather convoluted plot offers a disappointing conclusion Harlan Coben's strength is setting up an intriguing scenario for his thrillers with pace and tension in the early chapters. Again he accomplishes this here. However, to be a truly excellent thriller it needs to maintain the pace, and deliver an original and convincing denouement, with reasonable character development. Despite the promising start, the novel really disappoints on these following attributes. The plot is quite similar to some of his other novels, especially 'Tell no one', as others have noted, and to some extent 'Stay close'. The plot, when revealed, is rather convoluted and unbelievable (which I've noted in other Coben novels). Unusually the story sagged a little in the middle and lost a lot of pace, which is probably for the scenes to engineer the necessary plot twists. There are some good scenes, particularly around the drop-outs on the street, but overall the result is a novel which is rather average.",0

"disappointingly morose Should we compare to previous albums or take it on its own merit? I was expecting something poppy and upbeat and even though the odd track appears to be optimistic the lyrics are lamenting the past or the breakdown of relationships or about not being able to be who we ( he ) wants to be. I found the album as a whole quite difficult to listen to and felt quite miserable by the end of it; the repetitive negativity of the lyrics. He doesn't seem to like himself or his life very much if indeed the lyrics are autobiographical. If this is a purposeful change in direction, an opportunity to be taken 'seriously' then so be it. Some people may like it, I just don't want to listen to pain and anxiety on a 'pop' album.",0

A well made film. The story in this film is interesting and different; it didn't appeal to me greatly because I am more a fan of the action or mystery genres but that said I still watched it comfortably to the end.  The acting and photography are good and the score flows nicely. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes films related to WWII and also to those people who like films with a twist at the end.  It's a must-see for fans of Kate Winslet!,0

"Give it 80 pages and you may be hooked... 3*<br /><br />(I have a lot to say about this one)<br />It would be easy to dismiss this book.  The writer and his characters, I think, lack the moral compass.  That said, Oscar Wilde had something to say about what sin does to a person and how it can even affect one's countenance.  There is no cure for a hard heart or a life lived only to watch out for one's self.  Only tragedy follows such a path, as the lead character in this book learns.  Dorian Grey once yelled out a heartfelt plea to remain for the rest of his life as beautiful as he was at that moment.  His wish was granted and he never aged from that point.  The painting that he had just sat for, however, did change...with each and every selfish act he committed.  Dorian's actions were not always even meant to cause the amount of pain that they did, but they did nonetheless.  His gilted, innocent lover even killed herself over her remorse at having lost his attention and respect over something so temporal and silly.  From that moment, for Dorian, each hard and selfish act only lead to more of the same.  Disaster continued to follow.  Eventually he decided to change and live a life that was pure.  After one selfless act of love he expected the portrait to have changed back to one of beauty and when it did not he chose to end his life.<br /><br />Originally I would have rated this book as 1 *.  It took me about 80 pages, and a big devotion to go that far, in order to sort of get hooked by the book and its tale.  Overall I like what the book says about a life lived not only IN sin but a life that even reveres sinfulness.  For that I can finally say I am glad I read it and can understand its long-standing as a classic of literature.",0

"Unconvincing as whodunnit or sequel I have enjoyed many of PD James's books over the years and, seeing the posters on the tube before Christmas, was intrigued by the idea of combining a whodunit with a sequel to Pride and Prejudice.  I found the result very disappointing.  The whodunit was gripping for about three quarters of the way; but the solution was so complicated, and took so long to explain, that it was a struggle to keep going to the end.  Apart from that I found the style heavy handed and uneven.  Pieces of period detail were introduced in a very unsubtle and unconvincing way.  The language veered from modern to mock Regency and back again.  Overall I found it neither satisfying as a whodunit or a historical novel and, apart from the names, nothing really reminded me of Jane Austen.  I think this was a gamble by PD James which, for me, did not pay off.",0

"I was not disappointed in A Game of Thrones After watching the HBO series, I knew I had to read the books. I was not disappointed in A Game of Thrones; the story line was amazing and I can't begin to wonder how George R. R. Martin thought of this. A Clash of Kings does not disappoint - it carries on the perfection of AGoT and I can't wait to read the rest! I bought this book, A Storm of Sword (both I and II) and A Feast for Crows - and it all came to about thirteen pounds. In WHSmith, I bought AGoT for nine pounds; the value is simply amazing. If you are hesitant on reading ASOIAF, I would seriously advise you to at least buy the first three books while there is the three paperbacks for ten pound deal (which is basically three books for the price of one). If you don't like them, give them to a friend or a charity shop.<br />One thing I did notice, when I persuaded my friends to read the books as well, was that they were uncomfortable with the character's ages. Indeed, a thirteen year old Daenerys is a little hard to imagine, but I guess that was acceptable in Westeros; after all, it's a mythical place, so anything could happen. But even I imagine the characters at the age they are in the TV series.<br />So: buy the books. Watch the series. Fall in love.",1

"The early tracks aren't there. You can't go wrong with Bruce Springsteen's entire catalogue, and seeing as how most are on a very low price you could pick them at random and still have a lot of nice surprises (but maybe not the Lucky Town era). This compilation is an interesting mix of tracks, but it barely scratches the surface particularly of the pre Born In The USA time and centres too much on the ones since then. There's practically nothing from Greetings, The Wild, Nebraska and Darkness, the huge amount of live tracks are also overlooked, so I think this is aimed more at the very casual listener who isn't concerned what great album tracks they're missing. Sadly only Born In The USA and one track off Born To Run get all the attention on the radio, so I say to anyone you should buy any of the albums because they're all worth your time and worth a listen.",0

"It deserves every bit of praise it gets, and then some. My god, this is amazing. Ninja Scroll was released a year before I was born, and having finally watched it recently, it still holds up incredibly well.<br /><br />The story, though nothing ground-breaking, goes with the action very nicely, and has all the set-pieces for a memorable experience. The main protagonist Jubei Kibagami, as badass as he is, still struggles against his formidable foes, which creates both tension and a reason to root for the hero. Not only that, but the villains are all pretty out-there and unique in their own rights. The main antagonist isn't just some Saturday-morning baddie, either. He's someone Jubei has a personal bone to pick with.<br /><br />As you can tell by the BBFC certificate on the box, this film is not for the kiddies, so if you're not of age, then go back to your Big 3 debates and watch Naruto or something. This is a big-boy's anime!<br /><br />The action is like getting drunk on the best drink you can think of, and not suffering from a hangover the next morning. From start to finish, the whole film is beautifully-animated, and where a lot of these shows have to cut down on the visual detail to get more precise animation, Ninja Scroll manages to keep the two at a consistently high standard of quality.<br /><br />The music fits the theme of the show pretty well, and although it sounds a bit like something out of a black-and-white historic fantasy film at times, it kind of adds to the epic fight scenes.<br /><br />I felt that the film lasted exactly as long as it needed to. An hour and a half of awesome Ninja action that left me feeling completely satisfied and in high-spirits by the end. It doesn't tease you or try to make a point like a little OVA, but it doesn't overstay its welcome like a Lord of the Rings wannabe.<br /><br />Overall, Ninja Scroll is a must-have for anyone who enjoys anime or even animation in general. Sure, it can get pretty wacky at times, but the pure intensity sticks around to even it out nicely. Luckily,I only got this for £1, which is an absolute bargain, but don't shy away from paying full price for this movie, because it is worth every penny!",1

"Take That take a totally different direction... Hmmm... I have mixed feelings about this album. On first listen I have to say I was extremely disappointed and thought Robbie had completely taken over, but I decided to give it a chance, listen to it a few more times and try to let the music grow on me. To be honest, being a rock chick at heart I prefer the soft rock/pop anthemic sound of Take That's previous two albums rather than this electro style, but I suppose a change in musical direction keeps us on our toes. The problem is, I have always had reservations about Robbie returning to the fold and I really think, after hearing this album, it was probably a mistake. The two previous albums TT released as a foursome were far superior to this.     The first single to be lifted from the album 'The Flood' is, of course, classic Take That, and 'SOS' and 'Kidz' are ok. My favourite has to be 'Eight Letters' though, absolutely beautiful.    One thing though, why does Mark get so many solos when his vocals aren't, in my opinion, all that great? Gary has such a beautiful voice and yet he doesn't feature on this album half as much as I was hoping.    All in all though I suppose this is worth a listen so that you can make up your own mind. I'm giving it 3 stars.",0

Compared to most other authors I guess it would be a good read, but by his very high standards, I thought this book was slow and strangely empty.  The plot is sparse to say the least and the tension that is such a feature of his writing is lacking.  I think the merging of so many characters from previous books leaves so much of the page filled with unnecessary interaction between them that it doesnt leave a lot of room for much else.  It wont stop me from buying his next one but there are a hell of a lot of much better Connellys around than this, if you're new to his work, start with the Poet, you wont put it down.",0

"Managed to capture some of the feeling of the original, but add more modern touches I'll be honest, I approached this with some trepidation. The original film The Thing is a classic of sci-fi and horror, one of those films I watched as I began my awakening to the genre, and loved every moment of. Coupled with my general distrust of remakes, I wasn't at all convinced that this would be a sound investment of my time.<br /><br />Surprisingly, then, I can report I rather enjoyed it. It managed to capture some of the feeling of the original, but add to it with more modern touches. The film is actually a prequel rather than a remake, which begs the infuriated question, why does it have the same name as the original? I don't have the answer to that, but the film itself does fit perfectly into the original which is rather gratifying in itself.<br /><br />But that it works as essentially fan fiction to the original should not at all be the gauge of its success or failure. It must stand as a film in its own right- which it does rather well. The CGI rendering of the titular Thing gives it a rather different flavour, swapping the 80s gore effects which Carpenter was so fond of for a more Dead Space appeal. Indeed, the Thing more resembles the necromorphs from those video games than I remember previously.<br /><br />The story itself was sound, but then it was half-written by the film it was expanding upon. A team of Norwegian scientists in the Antarctic discover a crashed alien spaceship along with an alien frozen in a block of ice, and remove the latter for examination. Except it's not quite dead, and the alien cells can imitate human cells, and you can probably see where this is going.<br /><br />The pacing goes for a little less claustrophobic paranoia, and a little more big budget action, but I think that's more a sign of the times than anything- and aside from there being no real explanation as to why there is such an abundance of flamethrowers at Antarctic bases, it doesn't stray to far from the believability of the premise.<br /><br />One interesting note is that it does seem to be staffed by lookalikes. The female lead, at certain angles, bears rather a resemblance to Firefly and Stargate Atlantis actress Jewel Staite (but isn't). The can't-speak-English Norwegian heavyman looks sort of like Liam Neeson gone native (but, unsurprisingly, isn't). And the English radio operator looks the spit of Tim Roth (but isn't). None of which has any bearing on anything really, but I thought it was interesting...<br /><br />In the end, though, as much as I enjoyed the film I'm left wondering why it was made as a prequel to 1982s The Thing. Yes, it fitted perfectly with it, but that's because it was made to. It didn't have to be. It had flavours and inspirations from a variety of other sources, including as I've already mentioned the Dead Space video game series, and the first Alien vs Predator film. I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't pushed as an inspired-by-but-unrelated film, injected with a bit of originality and allowed to go its own way a bit more.<br /><br />Even straight-jacketed to someone else's film I enjoyed it, but I do think I would have enjoyed it even more if it was its own film. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who is getting sick of remakes, prequels and the like.",0

"After 4 years of waiting you'd expect more The album finally leaked yesterday morning so I got a chance to review it. Let me get just one main thing off my chest: Why do they still keep making 10 track albums (1 song is an intro and the other sounds like a demo at someones house party) that are 3 mins long? After 4 years you would of expected to have a bit more...15 songs atleast. <br /> <br />They definitely went for the more RAW sound which is actually great but the main problem is that only 4-5 songs express that and are upbeat. The rest are all slow/mellow/soft. The album doesnt \\""""suck\\"""", its ok. But thats the thing, compared to the previous generic over polished albums this one is just \\""""OK\\"""". Not their best offering at all.  <br /> <br />If you are going to change and make raw rock music, basing 60% of the album on ballads is not the way to go.",0
"limited edition vinyl I baught this \\""""limited edition\\"""" vinyl for my partner for his birthday. He collects limited edition vinyls and loves this band so I thought this was a great deal, however you will notice there is no indication on this page as to why this is being advertised as limited edition, when it arrived I still could'nt see why it was limited edition.<br /><br />I emailed amazon and asked them to clarify this for me, they sent it to another company who checked it and confirmed there is nothing limited edition about this vinyl. This is NOT a limited edition and Amazon did not even appologise for selling a long term customer a product using false advertising.<br /><br />I would not recommend that you buy this vinyl.",0

"Ben-Horrendous This film is long and boring. I like films and appreciate them, but I don't appreciate 25 minutes of straight dialogue in a boring room with boring characters talking about boring stuff. If someone said this is a great 'epic' film, someone lied. What's even worse than all that is the disc is double sided, one side is the first half, one side is the second. The two sides are not labelled at all and neither is the menu when the disks load up. I accidentally watched the second half first which is great... The films climax is a chariot race, I loved it because I love watching lifeless dummies being thrown off chariots and I love watching horses running in circles... Honestly though it the best bit of the film, I would recommend going on youtube, typing in &#34;Ben-Hur chariot Rae scene&#34; and watching that instead if buying the film. Despite the dummies and the repetitive nature, there's some good moments and some good deaths. I don't only like action films or action scenes, it's just in a film so boring, I think that scene added a bit if flavour.<br />Good delivery, I only buy off Zoverstock and they are genuinely the best DVD distributor on amazon, they clean all their discs before hand and they always work great... Just this once though, I wish the disc was scratched so I had an excuse to stop watching this awful film.",0

"Excellent basic stats not an SPSS16 manual! This is a fabulous undergrad text or a book for people studying research methods at post grad level. I had his first version which was an absolute life saver for me whilst doing MSc research methods, and much better than my set book. I'm now doing a doctorate and bought this to walk me through spss16 as it is quite different from earlier versions. It doesn't do this and he makes recommendations to other texts to do that. This is the hazard of buying books from amazon. If you want to learn stats from scratch then this is EXCELLENT but not for walking you through SPSS. In the earlier version there were lots of screen shots and these have been sacrificed for other stuff in here. Not a criticism of the book or the author who, lets face it, is something of a hero for his ability to make stats accessible.",0

"The Most Dissapointing Film of 2014 The hype surrounding this picture was amense, even 12 months prior to it's release.<br />Oh dear, what a let down. Weak story, poor dialogue, tried to eclipse the syle of Nolan's Dark Knight realism but in the end we are left with a dumb film about a giant lizard with a beer gut facing off against a giant moth. Even Godzilla's entrance was dissapointing.<br />Everything you see in the trailer is the destruction of Godzilla's adversary in the film and not of Godzilla himself (He doesn't show until over an hour).<br />Award winning actors Juliet Binoche and Bryan Cranston are killed off 20 minutes into the film and the film is left to Aaron Taylor-Johnson who doesn't have the weight as an actor to hold the film together. The role of his wife is so poorly written as she spends most of the film crying on the phone or running around a hospital or the street.<br /><br />My advice is save your money and go back to the best monster movie of the past 20 years - Cloverfield!!",0
Five Stars Just Brilliant!,1
"Pretentious and in need of a really good edit I have just spent ten days on holiday reading this book and I would like them back!  I was determined to get to the end in order to have a view but found the book poorly written, repetitive, pretentious and self obsessed.  The characters meant nothing to me and the bleak self destructiveness was miserable and pointless.  I kept hoping to find some depth or meaning in it but then in the end was left with ten pages of self indulgent pontificating nonsense!  I feel cross with Donna Tartt for expecting people to read all her ponderings, cross with her editor for not editing it properly and cross with myself for not being able to leave a book unfinished!  But at least now I have the right to a view.  And that was it!",0

"Dreadful........... Twilight on steroids doesn't even begin cover it when reviewing Fifty Shades of Grey, after all you have to give Meyer a bit of credit for at least having an original thought in her head. I'll start with the endless literary statements our 'heroine' makes; about books (she fixates on Tess of the D'ubervilles something serious)art (a couple of canvas on a wall are just amazing...) and classical music, specifically Christian's piano playing. I'm reading a romance I don't want to know the exact history of one of Bach's symphonies or whatever the hell it was, and a 'melancholy melody'?? I came up with better alliteration in first year. The pretentiousness of the author is unreal, don't just throw random references in to make yourself look intelligent!<br />I'll be perfectly honest, I only got as far as 25% on kindle and that was quite enough for me. The pathetic, squriming, wreck that is Ana just turned my stomach, the complete awe she has of him is crazy. The 'oh my' comments, the blushing every other conversation and the complete lack of gumption on Ana's part just makes this book any self-respecting girl's worst nightmare. Mr Grey (domineering, controlling idiot that he is) wasn't all that attractive to me, know matter how many times I was told about his eyes, hair, abs, arms, car, helicopter, buckets of money....<br />I find it impossible to fully explain how boring this book was, and to be fair some of the books I read are from publishers like harlequin, avon, the odd mills and boon, so really I don't actively look for much in a novel. Just a bit entertainment but there's only so many lacklustre sex scenes a girl can read. I did have a bit of a laugh at it for a while but eventually you just can't read anymore of E.L. James' rubbish, there's better stories for free. This novel isn't worth the paper it's written on, don't waste your money! :(",0

Four Stars Great film a real classic.,1
"So disappointing I want to start off by saying how much of a fan I am of the Delirium trilogy. I think the concept is amazing and believable, the characters are brilliant and the series as a whole is raw and well-written. So, after reading Requiem, I’m questioning… what the hell happened?<br /><br />Finales are meant to hold all the answers to the questions that readers have waited for, but Requiem left me asking more questions then I went into it with. She leaves characters with big ass question marks over them or just kills them, leaves story lines at loose ends and doesn’t solve any problems. I was expecting a book ripe with action and emotion, but I was left with a heart-hearted non-finish that wasted way too much time focusing on the crappy love triangle that arose in Pandemonium.<br /><br />Hopefully, if you’re reading this, you’ve already read the first two books, so can I just say a big WTF to Alex still being alive?! That’s just utter fairytale crap that Oliver put in to spice up the love element of the story. One thing I loved so much about Pandemonium was the fact that Lena found a way to move on with Julian because barely any books show the possibility of moving on any more. But then, Oliver killed that within this last book when Alex re-became a prominent character and at least 80% of things Lena seemed to do were switching between cuddling Julian, and pushing him away because Alex was there. It was a roller-coaster, but not in a good way…<br /><br />One thing that changed in this book was a multiple POV being introduced, and it was good old Hana Tate. If you’re like me, and it takes you a while to get through series of books because you read so many in between, you may be thinking: wait, who was that again? because of how little she got mentioned in the second book. But actually, I really liked the addition of Hana’s chapters, and the detached voice of a ‘cured’ was very interesting. It was great finally seeing what it was like in a first person POV to actually be cured of the ‘disease’. The additions to her personality and her actual storyline was pretty good too, and I really looked forward to reading her chapters, even more so than Lena (but that may have been because she was in love triangle land… snooze!).<br /><br />There were supposed ‘oh my god’ moments, but nothing that really left me wanting to throw the book across the rooms in a Silver Linings Playbook way. It also took an absolute forever to get started - at around 150 pages, I felt so lost in the mud of what was happening. I feel like Oliver basically knew she needed to finish this trilogy, but had no idea how, so she just started typing aimlessly of anything she could think of. Way over halfway, barely anything had happened and that’s when I knew I was totally done with the book. There was no way she could have resolved so much in so little pages, and I was right, because this novel practically ends in the middle of a street with bombs about to go off and characters about to profess outstanding declarations and confrontations. But then it just finished. No booms, no shocks, nothing. Now I’m wondering if my copy was missing an extra hundred pages or something.<br /><br />One of the worst things about this finale, not including the ending, was what Oliver seemed to have done with the characters. People I’d fallen in love with and grew to care for over the course of the first two books began to change in ways I couldn’t comprehend. Lena practically gave up on the whole cause, and Raven had lost all empathy and ferocity that made me admire her. It was such a shame, because I expected so much from them with the outstanding quality of the first two books.<br /><br />Overall, I am really glad I read this trilogy, and I would recommend it to anyone because of the real issues it brings up with love. Friendship love, family love, relationship love are all touched on in brilliant ways. It’s such a shame that the finale seems to have been done so emptily.een done so emptily.",0

"Of its time I hadn't heard this album for ages and I'd been trying to get just the first and last tracks as MP3's but I couldn't find them anywhere. To my ears this is not an album that has worn well. All the tracks are over long and I'd completely forgotten the long jazzy interlude in 21st Century Schizoid Man. Unfortunately, at the time this album was made, the bands ambitions outstripped their playing abilities and the jazzy parts are quite embarrasing to hear now, I wonder how the band feel about it. This type of music (prog rock?)was fairly new in the late 60's/early70's, although the path had already been trodden by Procul Harum and The Moody Blues, and was later bettered by the likes of Genesis. The jazzier side of prog rock was handled better by The Soft Machine. Unless you're REALLY into this sort of music I think this album is best left where it belongs, in the past.",0

"Songwriting Treat Some really good reviews here and I don't want to repeat the fine words said by others.  For me, The Promise is work in progress and lacks the finish that takes Darkness on the Edge of town so close to perfection.  I guess the best illustration I can find is the second verse of Racing in the Street    The Promise version:  \\""""Well now some guys they do it for the money  Other guys do it 'cause they don't know what else to do  There just ain't nothing left at home  Waking up in a world that somebody else owns\\""""     Darkness version:  Some guys they just give up living  And start dying little by little piece by piece  Some guys get home from work and wash up  And go racing in the street    ...in my opinion the best 4 lines anyone's ever written.  The tranformation of Candy's Boy which is OK but a bit of a plodder into Candy's Room which is a breathless panic attack of a song is another example.  For song writers this is a real treat as you get to see the great man's quality control in action but as a purely musical experience it falls a little short",0

"an album from a road-weary band This was the album that was released to coincide with their triumphant return to play Knebworth in '79. Such was the demand for tickets a then unprecedented second show was added the following week ( the one I went to, the one where it rained! ). This album was their chance to show the world they were still the kings of rock. What we got was an album from a band not quite sure what to play. There was the Eastern flavoured retread In the Evening, the blues rehash I'm Gonna Crawl. The soppy love song and then Carouselambra, which confused even the most die-hard of fans. To be brutally honest, Zeppelin had soared high, reached a glorious peak and had simply run out of ideas. It's certainly not a BAD album, Zeppelin don't make those. They had simply set their own bar so high. Over the previous ten years they had given us so much brilliance it couldn't sustain forever.",0

some good songs but still overrated and still cashing in not many tracks considering the price. people need to get into perspective that this is just an over rated band. the most over rated in history i would argue!

"another """"trick"""" in the wall..... Maybe someone do not feel the need of hearing again this beautiful album but,  tempted by the usual RE-MASTERED glittering trap and remembering this release has  always had a good sound (Vynil times...), someone falls in the trap ordering   another disappointing CD.  When I was a kid I recorded it on cassette, played it on my car in a just decent  Hi fi.... it sounded better than this bad re-master. The worse performance offered   by this cd is on the treble, sounding flat and metallic.  Other money thrown away, starting of having enough of these tricks!",0
"Amazon gets it wrong. Again. Whilst the album obviously gets maximum stars for its context, I must point out to unwary purchasers that this vinyl version is NOT pressed by Simply Vinyl (the boutique audiophile vinyl reissue company). There was once a version of this album by Simply Vinyl but this is most certainly not it! - This version is re-released by Rhino UK (the sales arm of Warners). It is a 180 gram pressing and I haven't listened to it yet. It might be great. It might not. But it certainly isn't as described here. - My guess is that it will be a vinyl transfer from a digital source, not from the original analogue master tapes...    Oh, and it's a damn sight cheaper on the official Rhino site and elsewhere.",0

"Disappointing lack of original characters Having loved all the previous books I found myself disappointed ny this one. I understand that this is an ambitious book with the author needing to add new characters and plots but there are no chapters dedicated to some major characters such as Bran, Daenerys, Tyrion etc so for me this was a major disappointment. I liked the fact that I got to know Cersei and Jaime better but it didnt make up for the shortcomings of this book. I look forward to reading the next book and hope it's more like where previous titles.",0

"Grabage This is one of the worst films of 2011.  It is full of the usual cliches: \\""""The Forbidden Forest\\"""", Skull cave, the buildings falling around them as they try to escape.  The dialog is also woeful.  I'm sure a school kid could have come up with a more mature script.  I sat and watched this with a few mates.  After about 20 mins in, we had a discussion to guess what path the film would take.  Guess what?  We were all correct; it was so predictable.  Again, another film that relies on, unnecessary, special effects.  Apart from not even looking very realistic, they just made the story go off on a tangent briefly.  Pointless.  I honestly wouldn't waste your money on this film.",0
"only half way up so far It is one of those albums you need to listen to many times before you fully appreciate some of the tracks, I am listening to these songs again as I write this review and they are growing on me.......perhaps in a few months time I shall change the star rating to a 4 or 5",0
"Too awful for words And yet I have many to add to the general damnation of this novel. Being a massive Jane Austen fan and former student of her work, I did not approach this book expecting a replication of Austen's style but with an interest in seeing some of the most famous characters of all time being thrown into a Whodunnit. The best bit about the book was the letter from Lady Catherine. Perhaps had James put more effort into getting the rest of the characters right, the Murder Mystery would have been easier for her to write. Austen wrote about what she knew- never are men seen talking alone, servants and ordinary folk are not detailed. P D James didn't have to invent a whole host of new characters. She already had a glittering cast . The set up was brilliant. Lydia arrives screaming that her husband , the naughty Wickham, has been murdered. 'Fantastic!' thought and my mind began racing. Whodunnit? A jealous and frustrated Lydia, or maybe Darcy had been driven to it. Fitzwilliam is here- maybe there was a dark secret between them. Even maybe that freckled girl he led on in the last book or the mysterious Mrs Young... Instead it appears that the author then poured herself a nice cup of tea and let her great grandchildren each take a turn in writing a chapter. £50 to the one of you who makes the least gaffs.....",0

"Warning Bruce Dickinson isn't on this album! Warning Bruce Dickinson isn't on this album!<br />The time in which Bruce Dickinson wasn't Iron Maiden's front man is considered by some as wasted years.<br />When and whether you should buy this album is dependent on a) what your knowledge of Maiden is and b) how many of their other albums you already own.<br />If you're new to Maiden I would make this your last buy and instead go after Live After Death, then Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, followed by Powerslave and Seventh Son.<br />If you have most of their albums I would consider purchasing this only before the stinker that is Virtual XI.<br />The fact is Iron Maiden would be considered today a cult oddity if Di Anno had remained lead singer but with arrival of Bruce the band went on to global domination.<br />There's much to like about this album in that it is the only Maiden album other than Number of the Beast to contain this particular guitarist line up with the rather brilliant Burr on the drums.<br />On these two albums Maiden just sound like a different beast as with some of the drum work on Murders in the Rue Morgue, the Ides of March and Purgatory.<br />The title track is just plain weird and I've never really liked it. I remember buying this album as a teen and thinking it was a massive waste of money due to Di Anno's singing rather than Bruce's.<br />These days I have grown to like the album a heck of a lot more but am so glad they gave Bruce s go after this.<br />Some regard Di Anno's time as the band's golden years  some don't but whatever you think of you're new to Maiden there are a whole load of their albums you should check out before this one.",0

"Where are we going? On Light Grenades, Incubus abandon the progress they made with producer Scott Litt, and offer the thunderous crashing of guitars, drums, and Brandon Boyd's yelling, but to an unsatisfying effect. It begins impressively, with the Radiohead-like \\""""Quicksand\\"""" cleverly transcending into \\""""Kiss To Send Us Off\\"""". The emotion and maturity of \\""""Dig\\"""" harks back to the days of 2001's Morning View, as does \\""""Anna Molly\\"""", the first single, which booms into a catchy riff. From here, however, the band lose their focus with heavy rock on the title track and others such as \\""""Rogues\\"""", and the pithy sentimentality on \\""""Love Hurts\\"""" and \\""""Earth to Bella\\"""" is taken too serious by Boyd to have any meaning. They may be enjoying what they're doing on Light Grenades, but for the ear, its an unremarkable, messy experience which fails to build on its promising start.",0

"Words not matched by dismal picture quality I give this book a 3-star rating solely because of Neil MacGregor's commentaries. The type design and setting is good and makes a dense text easier to read. Unfortunately, the words are not matched by the dismal quality of the pictures being way below what readers might expect for the cover price(who thought to set so many objects against a matt black background?). I am puzzled that such a prominent title bypassed the British Museum Press itself, which generally has much higher production values. Altogether disappointing and only worth purchasing at a heavy discount.",0

"Beautifully read I bought this for someone in her nineties, and was surprised to find how limited were the options.  Poor old CDs: just like downloads they no longer have the ease and simplicity of the old cassette tapes.  Can one stop anywhere and restart at the same place (sometimes possible with downloads)?  Not on a CD.  Can one rewind just a bit?  No chance.  Unless one can guarantee an hour's uninterrupted listening, this is most definitely not the format one could wish for.",1

"Dull, rehashed nursery rhyme nonsense. I waited a few months before reviewing this album.  The reason being is it is always easy to get excited about a new album featuring Liam/Noel Gallagher if you are a long time Oasis fan.  I remember being impressed with Dig Out Your Soul for the first few listens.  Naturally, the shallowness of the music begins to reveal itself with repeated listens, and invariably ends up on the shelf never to be listened to again.    The problem with the music that Liam Gallagher and co have presented in recent years is that it dates quicker than a half price packet of strawberries.  Upon hearing this album, I decided to give it at least 5 listens all the way through to make my mind up.  Thereafter, I convinced myself I liked 6 of the songs, then it was down to 4 of the songs, then 2 songs, then one song...then never to be listened to again.    To recap, things start off brightly enough with a powerhouse of a rocker in Four Letter Word...sounds kind of James Bondy...there's nothing new in the track...it's the type of rocker Oasis would open albums with...only now we have Liam choking the life out of the dire lyrics...sounds impressive enough, but it is only due to the sheer volume of the track! 3/5    Millionaire - This is supposed to be a kind of bright and breezy summer                 tune.  It does absolutely nothing for me.  Liam sings strongly                enough with parts of the song again sung on a double track                 giving it a Lennon feel vocally from a track you'd hear off                  Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet. 2/5    The Roller -  God, this song is so uninspiring.  It has been hanging around                 for about 10 years.  You'd think some improvements may have                 been made to it.  It's cliched and pedestrian.  It's got that                Instant Karma piano and drum beat but I'd liken it more to                 something you'd hear off Stereophonics 1/5    Beatles and Stones -  This is just embarrassing.  Only Liam could name-check                        the Fab 4 and the Stones in a song that sounds eerily                         similar to The Who's My Generation.  Totally dire! 0/5    Wind Up Dream -       This is another shocker.  No melody whatsoever in this.                        Think of it as something John Lennon might have sung                         if he let Yoko Ono write the song! 0/5    Bring The Light -     A bit of life.  This tune is derivative of music that                        came even before the 60s!! However, it sounds                          impressive enough, and at least Liam was doing                         something different for a change.  3/5    For Anyone -          It's interesting to hear Liam singing at such a high                         range on this one.  Very unusual for Liam.                        Reminds me of The La's.  3/5    Kill For A Dream -    This is Keep the Dream Alive revisited by Andy Bell.                          A total rehash.  I actually thought it was decent at                         first.  But listening to Liam trying to make these                         banal lyrics sound credible makes my stomach turn.                        It sounds more like self-parody. 1/5    Standing on the Edge of the Noise -   Good Lord this is dreadful. 0/5    Wigwam -              I do quite like Wigwam.  You can see there is a bit                         of thought and development in this track.  It is                         unfortunately a little too long and becomes                         repetitive.  3/5    Three Ring Circus -   Probably the best song Gem does on the album.  It                         doesn't mean that it is very good, though.  Utterly                        forgettable.  2/5    The Beat Goes On -    This is a total Lennon pastiche.  But I do like this                        one despite the lack of originality.  It has a nice                         melody.  4/5    The Morning Son -     Again, the drawn out ending spoils this track.  It                        is very nice, and Liam generally sounds really good                        on acoustic tracks when he holds back a bit, but it                        goes on way too long! 3/5      Decent finish to the record, then, but all a bit too little too late...the shockingness of the lyrics throughout coupled with the fact that there is nothing original here means I had to score it down to 2/5.  Like any of the final Oasis albums, Oasis die-hards can keep kidding themselves on that there is no greater band out there right now than Beady Eye, and that Liam is the best singer in the world, but everyone really needs to start accepting the truth.  Liam is done as a singer and has never been a prolific songwriter.  These songs have no sparkle whatsoever.  I was an Oasis fan, and will always cherish the early days, but you cannot keep pretending to yourself that they are releasing anything at all interesting.  I still hold out for Noel's solo album as I think it will be great...it has to be better than this tripe!!",0

"The Colour And The Re-Shape Time and again I have been disappointed by Foo Fighters albums, simply because every release after 1997 has failed to live up to The Colour And The Shape. Upon the release of every new album the band proclaim it'll be better than anything they have ever done but I don't think they will ever better this album.  This is when the Foos blended blistering rock with great melodies to near perfection.  Let's use Monkey Wrench as an example - a finely tuned rock beast with awesome riffs and the kind of \\""""free spirit\\"""" passion the band has struggled to maintain since.  This was an exctiting and accomplished album with almost no weak links and yet I find most of Foo Fighters new stuff relatively bland these days.      So why only three stars for such a damn good album?  Well the album in its original form certainly deserves the full five stars but I can't hide the disappointment in the 6 bonus tracks - they are crap!  The production isn't as good as the 13 main album tracks (presumably because the bonus tracks have not been remastered) and the vocals are dull.  Most are cover versions, with the exception of Dear Lover (a reasonable track I suppose - the only one!) and The Colour And The Shape (a simply dreadful mess of a track).  We also have a dull version of Baker Street..... yawn.  If you don't already own The Colour And The Shape then this is the version to get (for completist reasons if nothing else) yet I can't recommend the re-release to existing owners.  Unfortunately I feel I've wasted money on 6 bonus tracks I will never listen to, seeing as I already had the album.",0

"like John 5 I bought this album, because I was learning to play Beat It on guitar, like John 5...but, the whole album is really great! The thing I love about John 5 is that he doesn't (only) ''whiddley whiddley'' along monotonously as the likes of Yngwe Malmsteen etc, his style is different and, it's playable. He has breathed new life into the solo artist, which is so refreshing. Love it.",1

"Didn't Get It I saw a review for this on on a blog I follow a lot 'Girls Heart Books' which said they had used it with a book group and it spurred a lot of discussion. As I run a book group I thought I would request it from the library to give it a try.<br />My first reaction to finishing this book was 'What?!' I honestly had no idea what I had just read. I was confused and not entirely sure what the point was. But let me go back a bit.<br />The storyline is set in 1978/79 and follows the story of Miranda. Miranda is a 6th Grader who absolutely loves the book 'A Wrinkle in Time' which I will confess right now that I have never read it. She constantly re-reads the story but I'm not sure she particularly understands everything in it, the time travel seems to confuse her a little bit.<br />Miranda starts to receive mysterious notes which know things they shouldn't be able to know.<br />I have to admit to being confused throughout the book, I couldn't see where it was going. It was set up as a 'mystery'- with Miranda trying to find out who sent the notes, what they meant, why her friend stopped talking to her, what it's like to grow up, and what to do with the notes. But to be honest I wasn't particularly curious, I was just waiting for everything to come together but then when it did I didn't particularly care.<br />Saying that I didn't hate the book or anything, it was fairly easy to read and quit short. The characters each had their own charm, some I liked more than others. Marcus I found the most interesting, but it just seemed to drag a bit and jump off on random information.<br />It all comes down to the question of time-travel. I've said before I'm not a fan of time-travel in stories and I have to be really interested and it has to be done in a certain way to captivate me and this just didn't.<br /><br />There is a sub-plot to the story, Miranda's mother has been chosen to appear on the Pyramid Game on TV. I have actually heard of this and quite enjoy it. Basically it's a word association game where you get given words and have to guess what associates them. Miranda helps her mum practice and I enjoyed their easy relationship, and it was a fun input in the book but it didn't really seem all that relevant to the actual story apart from the link with one of the letters.<br /><br />Maybe if I had read 'A Wrinkle in Time' I would have enjoyed it more, maybe it just wasn't my sort of read but I just didn't get it. It just left me feeling confused and a bit deflated.<br />The chapters would make interesting discussion as each one is a 'category' like off the game show, e.g 'Things you hide', 'things that are yellow', etc. I can see my book group coming up with funny things to fitassociation game where you get given words and have to guess what associates them. Miranda helps her mum practice and I enjoyed their easy relationship, and it was a fun input in the book but it didn't really seem all that relevant to the actual story apart from the link with one of the letters.<br /><br />Maybe if I had read 'A Wrinkle in Time' I would have enjoyed it more, maybe it just wasn't my sort of read but I just didn't get it.

"A good beginning Although not as exciting as some of its sequels, The Bad Beginning sets the stage well for the later instalments. The key players are well introduced and are incredibly memorable but the finest aspect of the story lies in its writing.<br /><br />Snicket's style is vibrant and imaginative, spicing the serious subject matter with a dark humor that will appeal to readers of all ages. Although some may find exception with the repetitive nature of his narration, I found it to be charming and am really looking forward to seeing where this series goes in the future.",0

Excellent & charming book Not surprisingly the book is more complex and humorous than the movie (which is pretty good). Mr Torday has a good ear for the nuances of his characters' speech and dialogue.  The ending was a bit of a shock though it was appropriate.  The book is beautifully designed & printed.  A pleasure to read. I look forward to reading others of his (which he seems to be producing at a rather surprising rate).,1

Although I would rate this as the worst cure album. There are some very good songs on here, (10:15, three imaginary boys) but I just find the structure of songs a bit boring, there no keyboards or weird cure effects, just the standared drums, bass and guitar. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have the spark other cure albums have.",0

Not what I was expecting 3 albums 95% full of very dull songs - not what I was expecting as I thought he was a bit handy as a guitar player. A bit more research next time!,0
"I'm not going to say """"don't read this""""... I can see the appeal of this book for many readers. From the description and reviews, I thought it was going to be one for me. The opening chapters were intriguing, leaving you with that &#34;Ooooh&#34; feeling. Little hints and implied statements that &#34;nobody knows where he comes from&#34;, &#34;We do not know what language he speaks&#34;, &#34;there is something unseen at its base.&#34; These are great teasers, that should draw you in to the intrigue.<br /><br />However, Morgenstern uses these teasers so much, almost on every page and definitely in every short chapter, that I soon got fatigued by them. And, then, some of them don't even makes sense: &#34;We do not know what language he speaks&#34; is a cracker. Erin, you're the writer and narrator of the story. So, you must have some idea. It doesn't even make sense that you (we) don't know. More and more of this &#34;mystery&#34; is piled up - but we aren't actually given a mystery to puzzle over, we are just told &#34;you are mystified by this&#34;.<br /><br />The mystery is drowned in a sea of its own mystery, and nobody knows what the mystery was and where it is now because it is a mysterious thing full of mystery. STOP IT!!! PLEASE STOP IT, ERIN, YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY!!!!<br /><br />So, after a while I was thinking: &#34;You know what, Erin, I don't care if there's a mystery in this bit, because there's a mystery in all of it, and I've got that, so thanks, you don't need to keep badgering me about it. Just get on with the bloody story.&#34;<br /><br />The novel is Rococo in its design. It builds baroque trope on baroque trope until the narrative is severely impaired by what are essentially tricks. It's marvellous that Celia can turn one thing into another. I mean, actually, it is a marvel. There's magic in creation. Yup. Get all that. But after a while there is no marvel left because you've had so many marvels. It's like continuing to have sex post-orgasm. What should be a joyous event chafes. That's what happens here. There's no character development and no character development. No stopping all the chafing to have a chat and find out about each other, and enjoy each other's company. Nope, just more shagging, chafing, oww, please stop, yowchiness.<br /><br />So, what makes a narrative interesting? Well, one such thing is a great character. Just one would be a start. But even the main protagonists, A. H. and Hector Bowen are sketched so slightly that one has no idea why they do what they do. A. H. is a bit of a psycho really, who brings a child up in isolation, with study only. Then Hector is a bit of a psycho, wilfully breaking his daughter's wrists to teach her lessons.<br /><br />The rest of the crew become indistinguishable. Like cartoon characters. The sisters with an eye for design. The contortionist who speaks in cryptic short sentences that really don't convey anything. The impresario who throws extravagant dinner parties in London where you might expect one - at least one interesting person - to turn up.<br /><br />But you don't get anyone interesting. Ever. What you get instead is people who look interesting but are dead inside. They have no inner life. No sense of individuation or personality, but are clearly symbols allegories and ciphers placed there to add a bit of background colour to a narrative that simply doesn't move onwards.<br /><br />One of the other problems in this book for me was the writing style. It's lush, visual and has a very slow rhythm, with elongated sentences. And that should be great, but becomes a problem. Because without a short snappy sentence from time to time to wake me up, I feel like there's a nerd whispering in my ear just boring me to an early grave. I have trouble breathing when I read this book, that's how visceral my response to her writing is.<br /><br />So, I'm not going to say don't read this. I read Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast Trilogy where others threatened to slash their wrists - so I get that a book can be lovedby some and hated by others. But I will say, be aware that you're not going to read a thumpingly driving narrative, or meet interesting people along the way.<br /><br />What you will get is cinema. A long slow dream sequence that you may well fall into and become beguiled by, if (unlike me) you are lucky enough to get drawn on by the fairy light in the woods that leads you onwards to nothing.<br /><br />Enjoy it on that level.by some and hated by others.

Glad i readbit on line and didn't pay for it as would have been very very angry at parting with the cash. I'm totally disgusted and ashamed that this passes itself off as literature. My beautiful daughter Sarah Eileen, who passed away suddenly last year was in the midst of taking her writers degree and if she was still here with us would have gone onto writing. Sarah's book without a sprinkling of a doubt, be a masterpiece. This book is badly written, sad abusive drivel. I couldn't get beyond chapter 13 of this rotten book. God i'm angry.

"The death bell tolls... For some reason this Black Sabbath album has never really worked for me. For a start it marks the beginning of this group revisiting old riffs, ones that worked better on earlier albums. Iommi suddenly moved his guitar sound from deep and heavy to cheap and nasty; remember the old Frontline budget guitar effects in the 80s well this album is awash with them. However, this is the seventies and I suppose for the time this sound may have been advanced, it however does not carry well into latter decades. The lyrics lack the occult centered parodies of earlier albums and as such are far less sinister and thought provoking. Iommi suddenly decided to bring in backing strings for some tracks and this really does not work. I just feel that this album marks the end of complete originality and the start of repetition. You cannot seriously play this one and Masters of Reality back to back and not realize that Masters was so much more profound, insightful and iconic. This album is a mother, the previous were monsters!",0

"Good but not Madonna's best! Still worth buying! For me Madonna's best album's are True Blue, Like A Prayer and Ray Of Light. Yet again Madonna changes her music style and this is one of the reasons why she still remains Queen of pop. The main reason is that she is very good at writing excellent catchy pop songs. My favourite tracks are Candy Shop, Miles Away, She's Not Me and Incredible. I might be the odd one out here but, I find 4 Minutes to be one of the weaker tracks. Anyway overall Hard Candy is a good album which I'm sure 99% of Madonna's fans will enjoy.",0
"A New High Finally caught up with this film over the weekend and really felt I had to have my say! I was a big fan of the X-Men growing up, and like many others felt the entire franchise had been derailed after Bryan Singer's departure. First Class was obviously a great concept for a reboot, and I considered it to be in many ways the superior film of the series so far, if only for acting and coherence. But with Singer's return we have a truly creative director in charge again, and so the set pieces have a unique flair about them (particularly the rescue of Magneto) absent from First Class. By bringing in the cast from the previous films, there is an interesting issue that occurs. Outside of seasoned, often slightly hammy British thesps McKellan and Stewart, and obviously the perfectly cast Jackman, the supporting cast from the first series are notably less talented than the newcomers. Thus where limited actors like Halle Berry, James Marsden and Famke Janssen are fine but perhaps unremarkable in their roles, there is a notably different feel to the scenes with heavyweights Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, two of the most gifted actors of their generation. Hence this has upped the game - like Nolan's Batman Trilogy, it now has a truly talented director and a truly great cast. Can't wait for the next installment!",1

"Waste of Talent. The Hunger Games was supposed to be a controversial film (Lord of the flies, Battle Royale) yet it clearly pulls its punches, and is completely bloodless (controversy lite) typical 12A stuff meant for kids, how has such bland material become a franchise ? The only reason for the second star is the presence of Jennifer Laurence (Winters Bone) a fine actress who'd just have to stand up to improve this film, but even her talent is wasted, in the only one to one catfight she's defeated by Isabelle Fuhrman (Orphan) who's half her size. The Japanese film Battle Royale completely out guns this effort in all departments, Jennifer Laurence should have a great acting career ahead of her but she needs to keep clear of this type of movie even if it does bring her wealth, she could top the actor lists for decades.

"Hard Work I did read quite a few of the reviews submitted about this book but went ahead and bought it anyhow, despite being well warned.  If you like reading about self obsorbed, shallow, wise-cracking American females then you may just be able to wade through it.   Unfortunately I struggled to find anything about her that I could identify with, or even take an interest in.  A more suitable title for it would have been 'Me, Me, Me'  Strangely after watching her in an promotional interview, I really quite liked her, but reading her book almost made me lose the will to live.  Perhaps the film starring Julia Roberts, will make her 'journey' seem less pointless.",0

"A Letdown After Books 1 & 2. Firstly, I really enjoyed 1Q84 books 1&2 - interesting premise, engaging characters and when it finished, it left a lot of avenues to develop in the third part.  Unfortunately I don't think that the third book really achieved this.  The 2-person symmetry of alternating protagonists by chapter is broken with the introduction of Ushikawa as a main character - who never seems to rise above a 2D caricature.  The story doesn't really develop from the first books - it simply meanders along the same route.  I suppose if you see the whole of 1Q84 as just a single book separated into two for the purposes of marketing, then you might accept this, but if you are going to package the third part as a distinct book, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that it offers something extra or new - and this doesn't.  It's also very repetitive - you could have edited 100 pages out of book 3 without any impact on the story - and I found myself flicking through a couple of the chapters a couple of hundred pages in faced with yet another \\""""Tengo/Aomame sits around and does nothing much chapter.\\""""  There is a good story buried here - but it is in serious need of editing.  Given that a book with much potential but in desperate need of a good editor (Air Chrysalis)  is the central theme of 1Q84, that's a little ironic...who knows, maybe this is part of Murakami's meta-symbolism.  The ending seemed pretty hurried - Eri and her granddad just fizzle into the background, Ushikawa's character never really offers anything of interest, Sakigate is never really explored, and the central themes of the plot (ie the Little People, Maza/dohtas etc) are pretty much just left unresolved.    I think I'd recommend people read 1Q84 books 1 & 2 - but then not to bother with book 3.  It's not a bad book - it just doesn't offer anything extra.  Maybe Murakami is planning to write another book where he takes these themes further - and that this is the explanation for the somewhat unsatisfactory ending.  Well when he does write that book I'd be keen to read it - but this isn't it.",0

"Some dazzling displays of virtuosity, but overall lacks focus There is no doubt that the threading guitar of John McLaughlin, followed by the rocking trumpet solo to kick-start Right Off, gets the average (Open-minded) Miles Davis fan excited. What's not to be excited about? Miles Rockin' it up! McLaughlin's guitar! Hancock on keys! Cobham on drums! etc, etc.<br /><br />A Tribute to Jack Johnson was by far the furthest Miles Davis had strayed from his jazz background. While Water Babies, Miles in the Sky, and Bitches Brew had threaded his original style with a fresh, new electric sound, JJ was an all out rock assault, set to be a triumphant musical backdrop to the film documentary about the titular boxer.<br /><br />What I feel is right with this album is, first and foremost, Miles' playing. He completley owns proceedings throughout. There are also catchy riffs aplenty, and exuberant energy and style oozing from the drummer. However, JJ is swarming with problems.<br /><br />In the 70s, Miles Davis became increasingly guilty of making tunes in the editing room. He gets away with this on Bitches Brew's opener, Pharaoh's Dance, but both tracks on offer here are pieced together so unlovingly, it's almost insulting to the listener. There is also the style of music being explored. Miles' fusion albums generally only work when actually fused with jazz. The straight rock of this album (along with the straight funk of Pangaea, or the straight pop of his 80s period) proves beyond him and his band. If people want to listen to rock music, they should listen to Hendrix or Zeppelin- both of which easily eclipse this effort. In turn, the tracks do not go in any real direction, and the album as a whole criminally wastes its considerable musical talent.<br /><br />For me (a huge Miles fan), A Tribute To Jack Johnson represents a considerable dip in Miles Davis' form, a loveless collage against other people's handcrafted originals. It has more than a few good moments, but I consider my purchasing of this CD a minor waste of money.",0

"In a Word: Disappointing As far as I am concerned this is not Incubus, it is obviously the work of some space aliens that have simply taken over the bodies of Incubus to record an album. I'd go on to speculate that they have probably done so as some manner of scheme to brainwash and overthrow the population but yeah... back on topic.    When the last album turned out to be just a compilation I was disappointed. Before that, Light Grenades was not exactly Incubus at their best but was still good, this new album however... there is simply not a single song I will choose to listen to. It seems they have strayed even further into the Light Grenades style and removed any traces of their rock origins, whilst the melodies still sound ok and the vocals are fantastic it is just... pop. I genuinely don't understand this artistic decision.    Usually I will not like an album until the second or third play through when it has properly grown on me... but this, I didn't listen to a single song the whole way through, let alone the album. Played the first track, figured it would get better, skipped at end, second was the same, skipped, skipped, etc... real shame.    I just bought tickets to see them in London and honestly if I had listened to this album first I might not have done so. I've seen them live many times and they are always fantastic but if they play more than couple tracks off this I'll feel I've wasted my money...",0

"Did I miss something? I have had these books on my shelves for years, but have never got round to reading them, they were always my 'one day I'll read them' books. Then a couple of weeks ago my dad bought me the DVD of the movie, but I can't watch the film until I have read the books - that is my rule. So out came the book.<br /><br />I have heard some truly amazing things about this series so I was hopeful that this would sweep me into an incredible new world and I would be hooked. Unfortunately I wasn't though, don't get me wrong - i did enjoy the book but nothing about it made me go WOW! I will admit that I haven't exactly been in the best of moods lately which can affect the way you enjoy a book I know. But we can only ever review the book as we read them so here goes.<br /><br />I liked the start, I was intrigued and wanted to know more, the world was introduced well and the characters made you want to get to know them. The revealing of Clary's sight pulled me in and I found myself turning the pages to find out more. Overall I actually think this book is done well - it reveals the world bit by bit, adding more of the magic and mystery to it as you go and makes you feel part of it.<br /><br />I liked Clary as a character, she has a fiery determination to her and a fairly sarcastic wit which I liked.<br /><br />Jace - now I had heard rumours about Jace - that he was the 'ultimate book boyfriend' and 'totally dreamy' etc etc. But to be honest, I jsut thought he was a smarmy git who needed to get over himself. He really irritated me for most of the book, I only started to warm to him in the later part of the book and even only then a little bit. I just didn't like his attitude and blatant disregard for others. He has his redeeming moments but mostly I'd say he's a bit of a git.<br /><br />Now as for Simon for the first half of the book I wondered what his purpose was. From what I saw of him I was pretty sure the plot could have progressed just as easily if he didn't exist, but I liked him, he's a bit like a lost puppy but I liked him. I just hoped his part would become more relevant later.<br /><br />The rest of the characters help to create the world and bring it to life. I really like Isabelle - she's sassy, and Luke is a mystery.<br /><br />The world is very well created and the characters do come across as real and the sort of people you could meet. I liked the idea of the different groups and the history behind their organisation.<br />I wouldn't say that this book was totally amazing, maybe I just missed something that everyone else got with it, but I did enjoy it and am glad I read it. I am curious enough to read the next one and have already started it.im, he's a bit like a lost puppy but I liked him.

"Not worth the money, better to buy single(s) I bought this album a few weeks ago and I was expecting it to be great considering the likes of 'Mr Brightside' & 'Somebody Told Me' but when i got the album i realised that it only has 3 good songs, 'Somebody Told Me', 'Mr Brightside' and 'Smile Like You Mean It' out of the 12 songs on the album if you are looking for any of the above songs then i recommend that you just buy a single and not bother wasting your money on this boring album. Hopefully better things are to come from The Killers in the future.",0

"King's the king no more I love most books that King wrote. Although I prefer the supernatural, as in the Shining, It, and Christine, I've always been able to enjoy his other books as well. Until Lisey's story.  It's boring. It's slow. Worse, it's annoying. I was annoyed from page one practically, with the word bool and the lack of explanation the first 200 pages or so, with Lisey, who whines and moans all throughout the part that I managed to read. The moment she allows herself to be intimidated by some goon I had had enough, and leaved through the remaining umph-hundred pages to see what sort of end it had and then tossed the book aside - the first ever of King that I couldn't finish.  It seems King has run out of plots, out of imagination, and most of all out of words. What a shame.",0

"This House is Jerry-built The British thriller starring Ian Richardson and set in Whitehall and Westminster has been parachuted into Washington DC. Not entirely succcessfully. Unless one is familiar with the American form of government something gets lost in the translation. Brits knew where the characters fitted into our system and could, therefore, relate to them. This need not have been a major problem had the US plot been tighter. The UK plot was clear-cut and logical. It moved steadily towards the goal. This US series lacks pace. Kevin Spacey is a fine actor but, by Disc3, does one really care any more what happens to him? Robin Wright, as his wife, plays a character who makes Lady Macbeth seem cuddly - yet it is a two-dimensional character; a one-note instrument. I suspect this series will indeed appeal to Americans but, for me at least, it was a disappointment.",0
Epic with a capital E This is a really fun game. I like it that you draw your own character so it could be anything. I think they could improve it by adding a pencil so you can draw stuff to help you on your adventure and a rubber so you could rub stuff out to get places and with the pencil draw bridges to get places would be pritty cool. All in all a Truly Epic  game.,1
"Its different from Harry! I've read all the HP novels and was interested to see what would make this book adult. Well Harry doesn't do sex, drugs and violence and if he thinks about any of these topics they're not described in graphic detail. The book revolves around the sudden death of a local councillor and how that affects his friends, family, and his local community. JK cleverly illustrates the highs and lows of human behaviour and interactions.<br /><br />If you like a book to fall asleep to at bed time make sure you read the first 30 pages or so when well awake or risk forgetting who's who. There were 14 characters introduced in the first 14 pages. I ended up drawing a mind map to keep track of who was connected to who their background and ambitions.<br /><br />In HP one doesnt really question the credibility of characters/situations who knows how a bad wizard would behave in a certain situation. I found some of the characters and actions a little on edge of norm at time, esp the medical scenarios which weren't wrong but were at times unlikely.<br /><br />In HP there is some death and destruction but good triumphs over evil, I didn't have the same feeling at the end of this book, I have liked all the bad guys to get their comeuppance.  If you come home from work after a bad day and decline to watch Eastenders then this is also not the book to read as a pick me up.<br /><br />I could however see this as a 3 part TV drama a little in the vein of Midsommer murders (but with less murders) full of British character actors who would do justice to some of JKs complex characters perhaps they could film it with two endings and viewer choose real life or some thing more uplifting !",0

"Interesting Im always hesitant to read books that have so much hype surrounding them. This book is evidence of why. If I had just picked it up off the shelf, I might have considered it a good read but as it was with my higher expectations, I was let down slightly.    The book isn't very long, for starters, leading to some weak characters with not much depth. Even with Susie herself, I found it difficult to connect. The story din't have much by way of plot, and what there was was left unfinished.    I feel this book was more designed to make you think than to actually tell a story, which is fine, but there is so little emphasis on any particular point that you are a little confused as to what you are supposed to be thinking about.    All in all, Im glad I have read this book, but I wont be rushing to re-read it.",0
"Not as compelling as Kumon My son uses Jolly Phonics at school so we thought these would be good refreshers. Unfortunately they seem bland and 'school-y' to him and he quickly lost interest.

"Rory was spot on, unfortunately. This was conceived by his record company as an 'American' album and production was shifted to the said 'Frisco. However there were a couple of problems; firstly, the producer was Elliot Mazer (he of Neil Young's Harvest fame) - Rory had already rejected his mix of Calling Card, so maybe the 'cards' were already on the table. Secondly, he was beginning to have doubts about his entire band. He wanted to return to the power trio and the notoriously stingy guitarist was becoming somewhat exasperated by their continuing demands for more money.  This album contains some great songs, but the band sound cluttered and the production is all over the place. There are indeed some belting songs, its just that better versions are already out there. Mississippi Sheiks, for instance, takes forever to get off the ground and the oddly double-tracked vocal on Overnight Bag seems to rob it of its power. The saving grace is of course Wheels Within Wheels (two versions) but even then I prefer the stripped down version which was posthumously released on an album of the same name. And then there's Out On The Tiles, which I imagine would have made a great live performance.  Rory threw the acetate in the bin rather than let his record company hear it and went on to release Photo Finish as as a trio instead. It was a far more focused and powerful affair, though sadly Wheels Within Wheels was put by the wayside. A real shame as it was at least an equal to Edged In Blue.   The live album is wonderful and full of energy that doesn't let up for over an hour. Don't be expecting a soundboard quality of sound though, its more or less on a par with 'Waiting For The G-Man'. Still a wonder to hear though.  Didn't mean to gripe so much, I think that Rory was the best blues/rock guitarist ever to have emerged from the British Isles; I'm actually not doing him a disservice, I'm saying he was right all along.",0

"On the boundary between 3 and 4 stars but no better I don't quite get what all the fuss was about with The Beatles. I like their early Rock 'n' Roll based work and understand that they were among the first groups in Rock 'n' Roll. In the main previously most Rock 'n' Roll artists were soloists with sometimes with the backing group given an \\""""and the\\"""" billing.<br />By the time The Beatles came into prominance Rock 'n' Roll had been well and truely established by the American legends, so I don't see them as particularly great revolutionairies and I suggest claims that they were revolutionairies in the Rock 'n' Roll field are generally greatly exaggerated.<br />They did move onto other forms of music of couse with Psychedelia, which is where they would have a greater claim as revolutionaries, but I just didn't get that at all.<br />So the best of Rock 'n' Roll is on disc 1 and this on it's own is worth 4 stars. From disc 2 you notice a change and tracks like \\""""Norwegian wood\\"""", \\""""Michelle\\"""" and the god awful \\""""Yellow Submarine\\"""" turn me right off.<br />So a play list is in order were \\""""Love Me Do\\"""", \\""""Please Please Me\\"""", \\""""She Loves You\\"""", through to about \\""""Drive My Car\\"""" feature.<br />Personally though I would get a bigger play list from The Rolling Stones, who were there at the time and as group far outlasted The Beatles.",0

"Was this book written using a thesaurus? Dull, pretentious and undeserving of the award it was given.     After reading several reviews, I powered through the first few chapters of this self indulgent drivel only to be greeted with a couple hundred more pages of it. The page count of this book could've easily been cut in half if it weren't for all the words-for-the-sake-of-words. I found it dull all the way through and regret that I gave it a chance after being insanely unimpressed with the first few chapters.    Don't waste your money and even more importantly, your time. You're better off typing various words into an online thesaurus and reading that - the results will be more or less the same.",0

I also resent 42 pages of this quite slim offering repeating the book that went before it, which I had already read. That book was weak but I gave Mr Grisham another chance as he was introducing a new character. This book was so half hearted, even teenage readers would be resentful of the time (and money) they wasted on it. A harsh criticism but a deserved one.

"Talk Like You Although this has just gone on release in the UK, I think the film has been hyped up a bit. Having just watched my imported disc I must say I was a little disappointed in the film, the story line as regards to the little orphan was heartwarming but the rest has all been seen before in David Attenborough films so it lacked a bit of sparkle, as for the photography this was really good when you condider what they have to go through in the jungles.

However, I did get used to the fomula but still found it confusing with the three-way conversation to the dead sister, the writer and the third party and I know that the person to whom I gave a copy at Christmas couldn't cope with it and gave it up! On the whole it was quite exciting but sort of drawn out. I guess that I prefer the usual approach without all these gimmicks which older readers seem to find a distraction.  Another novel that I recently read and really loved was \\""""Help\\"""" by Kathryn Stockett, which had a similar approach but the pace was much faster and it was easier to follow.",0

"Ragbag collection of 'nice' songs..... He released Journeyman in 1989 which had its moments and then, as far as an original album of material goes, there was Pilgrim and then this, 2001's Reptile. Pilgrim was full of strong songs that were poorly (or overly) produced by Simon Climie. This album has fairly weak material that Mr Climie seems to have had sound more natural. Which is a shame because the songs on Pilgrim are so much stronger and ones that Eric really cared about. In comparison Reptile is a real curate's egg; some great, some not so, mostly indifferent. Even worse, Back Home, the follow up in terms of a 'normal' Clapton album, was not only weak in terms of songs, but those 'orrible production values were back in the fray.    Reptile has at its heart an interesting concept involving Eric's upbringing (Reptile being a term of endearment), but the only musical references are instrumental. How wonderful had he taken the time to write songs around the theme he clearly has in his head. Instead, we have a bunch of covers and some lightweight original material. For the record, the best track is a cover of Stevie Wonder's I Ain't Gonna Stand For It Baby. Don't let this be your first Clapton experience, go for Layla, 461 Ocean Boulevard, Slowhand, Journeyman, or if you're splashing out, the wonderful Crossroads 1 and 2.

"Enjoyable read if a bit prosaic Outliers is certainly an enjoyable read that does entertain but at the end of the day the argument Gladwell puts forward is a bit on the prosaic side and is made a bit redundant at certain points. He posits some intriguing, although hardly revolutionary, concepts about the requirements for success and then reinforces them with a string of anecdotes. Although arguably one could not say that his argument is flawed or the idea he is promoting erroneous the sheer volume of statistics and anecdotes he provides in support of his thesis does not so much prove his theory as highlight how ultimately simplistic and unoriginal it really is.<br /><br />All in all an entertaining read that provokes some food for thought but hardly life altering or even really challenging",0
"In a word....dreadful. Oh dear. What has happened to this once great and groundbreaking band? Love or hate them, Yes were responsible for some of the finest non-4/4 songs ever written and were an awesome live act. Unfortunately, the performance on this live CD is downright embarrassing as 'Yes' now struggle to play their own songs. The rhythm section are all over the place with the only saving grace in the vocal performance of Jon Davison, but still no where near as good as Jon Anderson in his prime. Please don't remember them like this - listen to Yessongs, Yesshows or 9012Live and remember them as they once were....",0

"OMG!!!!!CAITLIN DOES FEMINIISM!!!!!! Where do you START with THIS BOOK?Quite apart from the copious overuse of exclamation marks AND UNECESSARY CAPITAL LETTERS,the content is simply an extended opinion column,rather than actually relevent to the lives of most women, including myself.Moran terms herself at one point a \\"""" radical feminist\\""""- oh please!!!!Someone who writes regularly for the Murdoch press hardly qualifies as a radical anything. Her flimsy arguements in support of pornography I found astonishing.Clearly she has no idea of the wholesale exploitation of people involved in this industry and the huge damage caused in the reduction of people ( men & women) to mere objects.<br />If feminism means anything at all then surely it is about fighting such a view of all people.The fantasy that everyone involved in making porn is doing it freely without co ertion is at best naive, at worst culpably ignorant.<br />No doubt Moran will happily keep churning out garbage like this( and getting paid not inconsiderable amount of money for doing so) for many years to come as she seems to be something of a media darling presently.She could undoubtably get the contents of her last weeks shopping list published simply BECAUSE SHE WROTE IT!!!!!<br />Avoid this book- it has nothing to do with feminism and WILL DO YOUR HEAD IN.",0
"decided that a remake wouldn't be a bad thing. As remakes go I actually remember seeing the film advertised in the National Press, way back in the 70's, and vaguely remembering the original film, Wages of Fear, decided that a remake wouldn't be a bad thing. As remakes go, it works quite well, Roy Sh eider (then only mainly know from Jaws plays a good lead, the film itself is really good, atmospheric & tense throughout,, as we watch man battling against nature to try and deliver a cargo of unstable Nitro Glycerine to an oil drilling site in order to avert a disaster, you can almost feel your clothes sticking to you as you witness the cast battling though the rain forest in a torrential downpour.<br /><br />The film is also helped by a brilliant soundtrack by German Electronic wizards, Tangerine Dream, it really does help create an atmosphere.  Just as a side note: not long after I'd seen the film I noticed the Album Soundtrack for sale in my local record shop (anyone ever remember them)? ;and snapped it up, reading the Album notes at the time, it Said that the producer William Freidkin (of French Connection and Exorcist fame) contacted Tangerine Dream specially, to record the soundtrack, at the time they were already recording an album of their own, so couldn't make it over to the sound studio, Friedkin sent them a synopsis of the film,, and shortly after they obliged, so you have a soundtrack written &#34;blind&#34; basically",1

Fifty shades of grey Utter utter rubbish what is the big deal with this book read first one thought it was really repetitive but i was told the second book was much better so thought id give it a go what a HUGE mistake half way through jus cant possibly read any more its the same thing chapter after chapter theres no story there its the worst thing ive ever read and the saddest thing is im never going to get the time i wasted reading it back my opinion dont waste your time or money buy a pot of paint and watch it dry much more intresting,0
"Don't ask me what this is about ...because I just couldn't get into it. It was disjointed, garish, narratively peculiar and difficult to follow. There was too much film art going on, too much visual feasting and too much invention and intervention. Good films flow. This one was not given the chance to, although it is good to look at in places and at times entertaining. You can certainly tell that the director comes from the world of pop videos.",0
"A nicely flowing instrumental laid back album This is not the best album that Pink Floyd have ever produced, but there are still some nice sounding tracks here.This is a very mellow laid back album where most of the tracks are instrumental.Only one complete vocal track.If you are looking for a new sound from Floyd you won't find it on this album.Some of the sounds on this album originate from the Division Bell, old master tapes,tracks dropped from other albums,remixes etc.",0
"No change in 4 years. Got this album for Christmas a few years ago. After really liking 'The Divine Conspiracy' I requested this album without looking into it beforehand. Wish I had now. Waste of money for the person who bought it for me.<br /><br />So I listened to it all the way through a couple of times and was sadly disappointed. A couple of solid good tracks include Resign to Surrender (minus the spoken bit), the last minute of Unleashed where Simone's vocals induce goosebumps, Burn To A Cinder and White Waters.<br /><br />The rest of the album is just....meh.<br /><br />Recently listened to this album again (January 2014). Thought I'd give it another chance. I really really want to like this album but there are just too many little details that ruin the whole thing for me.<br /><br />1. The whole Freedom theme. Outdated, preachy and boring.<br />2. Spoken passages? Nooooo! Music or singing please, no speaking moments!!<br />3. Martyr of the free world. The weakest track after the pointless The Price Of Freedom<br />4. Too much grunting vocals, not enough Simone<br />5. The freedom thing again. I just don't like it.<br />6. Bonus track Incentive. Certainly not worth the extra pounds.<br /><br />Never have I found more disappointment in an album. A killing album for me in never looking into Epica again, just like Imaginaerum (whatever the spelling) from Nightwish.<br /><br />Avoid.",0

"Death by Clipping Simply the worst production on any album I've heard.  10x worse than ...ajfa.  Hugely ironic given the band's anti-piracy ranting.  When I buy a cd I want to stick it in my hifi, turn it up, and enjoy it.  Fat chance with this.  Turning it up is out of the question.  Better to get a low quality version where the clipping is less in your face.      4* for the music - it's pretty good although perhaps a little boring in places, but since I can't bear to listen to it that's not much good.  On the odd occasion I persuade myself to give it another go it only takes me a few minutes before I simply can't stand to listen to it any more.  God only knows what they thought it sounded like.  It's pretty clear to me at this point that nobody in the band has any hearing left.",0

"The Velvet Underground Is Dead To stop any more people from getting their knickers in a twist, I've decided to amend my review, since my feelings towards the album have changed, though it's still far from a classic in my eyes.<br /><br />I initially found album was so appalling that I actually only managed to get so far in before I had to stop listening to it.  It wasn't because the music is bad, in fact it is actually quite good, and arguably this album has the best production qualities as well, but it sounded to me obviously a ploy to make the Velvets into something they were not: a soft, mediocre pop group.<br /><br />Their first two albums pushed boundries, whether it was Cale and his instrumentation, Mo and her drumming, Lou with his controversial lyrics and off-kilter voice, and let us not forget Nico and her trademark beautifully tragic voice which lends itself to their stunning debut.<br /><br />In this album we get barely any of those things.  Cale is gone and Mo is on maternity leave.  As for Nico, she had gone on to create even more uncompromising records of her own.  Even the excellent bassist/guitarist Sterling Morrisson's appearances are scarce, leaving only Lou Reed behind with Doug Yule, who takes over the vocals on a fair few of the songs with his more melodic voice.  This might be good for some, but for this listener it just didn't feel like the Velvet Underground I loved and it came as a bit of a nasty surprise.<br /><br />I then wrote this review a little hastily, but I've given the album a few more listens since then and come to kind of like it.  As I mentioned initially, 'Rock and Roll' and 'Sweet Jane' are fantastic tracks.  'New Age' is another classic, though I do wish Lou had sung on it rather than Yule, as his voice just doesn't sit well with me, though his performance of 'Candy Says' on the previous album was fantastic, and he does work well I think as a backing vocalist.<br /><br />Still there too many drawbacks for me to fully appreciate this album.  However, if anyone is interested in slightly off-kilter pop/rock music then I would recommend this album, though don't expect anything too ground breaking here. If you want that, either go further back into the Velvet catalogue or invest in some of Lou Reeds more experimental work, or Nico's 70's albums, both of which are mesmerising.<br /><br />Very dissapointed.  This album only gets two stars because there were some tracks, Rock & Roll and Sweet Jane, which were great and I will return to.",0

"Awful Game This game is advertised on TV as an amazing game full of great 3d graphics and multiple camara angles, Its not. After playing the game a lot I reached rank 9 and at that point everything became 1day to complete. To skip this you have to pay money. The community on this game is awful. You can get kicked from alliances for defending your self. Worst part is? They have censored the word gay but they have no censored f*g Since loss play this game I find it truly offensive that they censore gay and homo but not f*g. This is stupid. The game does not have these amazing reviews you see on TV they have obviously been bought.<br /><br />Overall waste of time and space",0
"Keeping Kleenex shareholders happy On one level this is an American weepie, the kind that is so thick with syrupy family love that you don't know whether to swallow it down or cough it up. On another level it takes a very modern dilemma and makes a good fist of illustrating all the central moral questions and side issues of its theme. Well-written with believable characters (well, what passes for believable in Jodie Picoult-land), with everyone trying so hard to do the right thing. That's what America was built upon - and they've been selling this idea to the world for so long that it's no longer distinguishable from whatever truth they can drag up from the cynical, intelligent core that must be in there somewhere.<br /><br />Nevertheless the story is so gripping that you cannot but read it to the end. Immerse yourself in the very modern ethics of genetic propagation. A mother so wants to save her daughter from leukaemia that she has a child who will be able to donate - at first just umbilical blood. When that doesn't work the donations keep on coming. But when the child herself - at thirteen - cries, \\""""No more,\\"""" and gets herself a lawyer, the scene is set for a family to tear itself apart. You wouldn't go to see it in a cinema unless you were already deeply depressed, but a book has more gravitas so the experience works differently and this has become a best-seller.<br /><br />If you can bear to leave your brain behind and stew in the warm bath of pure sentiment, this novel won't tell you much that's original, but it should keep Kleenex shareholders happy.",0

"Disappointing This is my personal view and, of course, it may well be completely wrong.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy this film at all. If I hadn't known that it was an Italian film I would have said it was one of those heavy French films. Slow from the beginning to the end. Also at times awkwardly noisy.<br /><br />It offers an insight of a certain current decadent layer of Roman high society, which from my Italian point of view I suppose it could be extended to other Italian big cities, too. The main character can't bear up the hypocrisies of certain members of his clique, and at times he speaks up.<br /><br />He realizes the way he is; he knows his own faults; he knows he will never be able to be normal, in the sense of ordinary with a wife and a happy family or relationship, as he is already in love, in love with Rome, its life, and its beauty.<br /><br />Good snapshots of Rome, but those are not enough for making a good film.",0
"EFK The game is fun to play, with many good aspects. The tutorial is easy to understand with good pointers on how to progress. But like most people say they do PUSH the sale of rubies onto you.

"Brooklyn I found this cliched and rather dull with nothing new to say about the Irish experience or emotional life.  I found Ailish pretty one dimensional - that is straight down the line with no complexities - I am not sure that Colm really understands how a woman thinks. Even when she is confused about her feelings for Tony, this is not examined in depth.  In fact all the characters lack depth. He is a great novelist but this is by far from being one of his best books. Disappointing.",0
"Rolling Along Pretty much more of the same.  The golden rule that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished doesn't seem to hold sway here. There seems to be an almost sadistic pleasure on the part of the writer to strike out at those who are just dusting themselves off  from the last blow of destiny.  The series starts out at a furious pace and then slows down to a better tempo.  On the whole, it  gets better a bit further on.",0

"Try Before You Buy I bought this album without listening to it, on the back of a magazine review where it appeared as one of the best albums of the past 15 years.  <br /> <br />It was a mistake. It's not that I can't see there is talent in this man. His words form gripping prose and solemn poetry and what he must have experienced to be able to write it, God only knows. It's a catalogue of frustrating nightmare experiences. Of despair, in fact, with desperate music to go with it. The music is a perfect soundtrack to the story but really, it's the pits, being largely a loud, tuneless, grating cacophany that jarred the senses and made me want to turn it off long before the end. It might be the right soundtrack to complement the lyrics but it's a horror. Pass it by. You could hear more music stood next to a weaver's loom. <br /> <br />In films you can experience life in all its forms without being physically hurt, addicted, or abused. Know then what to avoid and understand those who couldn't avoid it. The horror experience works in the cinema but it's dire when it's put to music, and that's what youv'e got here. Despite the quality of this musical nightmare in the way that it has been written performed and recorded, it is not enjoyable. It might be an exprience that widens your horizons in a way that sunny little songs from the pop charts can't, but for me it isn't music. It's monotonous grief. Harsh irritating stories about somebody wasted. It was ten quid wasted for me.",0

With Kenneth Branagh as director, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins in the cast I expected so much better...<br /><br />I could not feel any interest for the story or the characters. I wanted to feel empathy for them but got nothing. The director did not spend enough time to develop their personality and background. Scenes were coming one after another without creating excitement. The acting was bad, very cliché. The special effects did not really help: Thor's world is very smooth and shiny, and very dull.<br /><br />All-in-all a bad movie, certainly not worth 12 pounds.",0
Five Stars Amazing book.,1
"Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan - So don't fear if you hear, a foreign sound to your ear? Whilst the phrase \\""""its for a good cause\\"""" should be a prime consideration when reviewing this album any listener can't help but face the fact that this is a very long curates egg of an album with the balance just about tipping towards hits than misses. It is a humungous amount of music for the price and great VFM, but frankly had it been cut to a double or even a long single album it would have been a better outcome. Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Amnesty International and their wonderful ability to shine light into the darkest corners of human rights violations deserves something really special. Sadly this is not it. With over 70 songs from such a strange brew of artists it was inevitable that quality and variability would be an issue. Equally while the compilers have used up to date covers of the Dylan cannon the absence of Hendrix, Neville Brothers, Dave Alvin and especially the Byrds does leave an aching gap. This is compounded by seeking to accommodate all comers when a \\""""stop and proceed no further\\"""" policy should have been more selectively employed.  In particular someone should have boomed out in Gandolph like tones \\""""YOU SHALL NOT PASS\\"""" to Maroon 5 and their pedestrian cover of \\""""I shall be released\\"""", cried halt to My Chemical Romance's butchering of \\""""Desolation Row\\"""", informed Silverstein's that producing an EMO version of \\""""Song for Woody\\"""" wasn't a great idea and let us not get started on Mick Hucknell's laughingly bizarre Dylan impression on \\""""One of us must know\\"""". This is by no means a complete list of some of the atrocities here with Sting's \\""""Girl from the north country\\"""" easily being the most irritating thing on the album while Cage the Elephant should be summoned to appear before a angry judge for their heinous version of \\""""The lonesome death of Hattie Carroll\\"""".<br /><br />Thankfully there are more counterbalancing influences. Steve Earle and Lucia Micarelli take on \\""""One more cup of coffee\\"""" is up their with the original. Not surprisingly Lucinda Williams gives \\""""Trying to get to heaven\\"""" a suitably Southern wasted tinge and as far as this reviewer is concerned giving Tom Morrello and the Nightwatchman \\""""Blind Willie McTell\\"""" to cover is a stroke of righteous inspiration. The \\""""Changing of the Guards\\"""" is profitably rocked up by the Gaslight Anthem (perhaps Dylan rather than Springsteen should be their muse?) and My Morning Jacket rise to the occasion with a ghostly alt country version of \\""""You're a big girl now\\"""".  Old Pete Seeger doesn't so much sing nowadays as speak but the tireless campaigner has done more than most to champion human rights than just about anybody and his \\""""Forever Young\\"""" had to be here. Another Pete, this time in the form of Townsend does a lovely version of \\""""Corrina Corrina\\"""" while the dreamy shoegaze of the Silversun Pickups version of \\""""Not Dark Yet\\"""" works rather well.  Nice also to see Mark Knopfler back on form with a great \\""""Restless farewell\\"""". Mention in dispatches should also go to Jackson Browne, Carly Simon, Diana Krall and Patti Smith. The covers in the US which seems to be generating most controversy are Ke$ha's \\""""Don't think Twice its alright\\"""" and Miley Cryus \\""""You gonna make me lonesome when you go\\"""". The latter version is a inoffensive passable cover and Cryus has a nice country twang to her voice. Ke$ha alternatively does a raw strung out (overwrought?) version of \\""""Don't think twice\\"""" which is going to split the jury but to be fair it is at least a radical attempt to deconstruct the original.<br /><br />So there you have it an album that will generate a fair share of talking points which is probably Amnesty's underpinning motivation and hopefully draw a new generation to the wonders of Dylan. Certainly if you come from the \\""""don't mess with perfection\\"""" school of Dylan appreciation this album will be a source of high irritation and returning to the starting point there is something not quite right here. A \\""""less is more\\"""" approach would have been a better policy but we are where we are. That said well done Amnesty International.  Happy 50th birthday and keep up the great work.ernational.  Happy 50th birthday and keep up the great work.",0

"Absolute rubbish and badly written This must come very close to the worse book I have ever read.<br />A highly unlikely plot coupled with terrible American type prose bored me from start to finish.<br />There are many good crime writers out there, Kathy Reich, Michael Connely,<br />Tess Gerritsen and Peter James to name but four, so why waste<br />time reading this trash.<br />With all the wonderful prose available to us, it sickens me<br />to see praise heaped on this.",0

"Brilliant film Clear picture and sound. There are 3 versions of the film on this DVD including original, extended and work in progress. A brilliant watch and would recommend.",1
"grim and unpleasant I watched this after being gulled by the excellent hype - a lesson in not believing film publicity just because of the awards, or the cast, who should have known better. I found this film too long, tedious, disturbing and offensive.  The idea/action link of the gun, owned by someone in Japan, and its impact on a tourist and a goat herd in the middle east seemed a clever device at first, but along the way there was so much tosh and irritation I lost patience. Yes, it's a small world, but no thank you to the weirdo connections and frankly dodgy behaviour of some of those portrayed in this. If I'm going to take my brain to the cinema I far prefer things like the \\""""three colours trilogy\\"""", with \\""""Blue\\"""" being searingly moving in a much more life affirming way than this nonsense ever achieves.",0

"Middle Class Guff The fact that I am on this website looking for other books to read is probably enough to show how terrible I am finding this book. What was all the fuss about? Shortlisted? I am on page 192; and will give it to the end - but so far it is cliche ridden and child-like. The writing is clumsy and I surely am not the only one who finds the premise that in a rough street in Taunton, Harold is be-friended by an Easter European who is actually KIND a sad reflection of blinkeredness. Does Ms Joyce think that only people with Agas are kind? I am embarrased for her. It will be interesting to see if my opinion of this book changes when I have finished it. I will persevere. Watch this space.",0
"A Malenky Bit Marvellous Ignoring memories of Kubrick's iconic film, in spite of its brilliance, is probably the best way to go about enjoying this incredibly electric novel.<br /><br />As a Joyce fan and critic, it's perhaps unsurprising that Burgess experiments with an unfamiliar style with the creation of 'Nadsat', but the poetry and power of the prose is the factor that elevates this book to its classic status. In fusing Russian, English, and trace elements of other languages, Burgess intellectually engages the reader, challenging them to decrypt the language, yet without the erudite inscrutability of 'Finnegans Wake'. It's this creativity that allows Burgess to display deft touches, in the brilliance of his lexical choices. Examples that spring to mind are \\""""Bog\\"""" and \\""""Horrorshow\\"""" - these are fine details that really characterise the novel.<br /><br />The novel's central ethical question is also timeless - the 'needs' of the individual versus the 'needs' of the many. In tying lawless Alex to Beethoven, Anthony Burgess also adds an artistic depth to the argument. What are the boundaries of artistic expression? This is an issue we feel more urgently in the wake of Post-Modernist art than we ever have before, and this, in my opinion, is certainly a springboard for many of the artistic choices made in Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film.<br /><br />Alex certainly earns a place in the pantheon of great narrators - up there with Holden Caulfield, Pip and Ishmael. It's difficult to dislike Alex, as so many shocked readers have noted. His taste may be unusual, but it is unarguably refined. His love of Beethoven, surely the best composer to have ever lived, is also a master stroke. The result is that suggesting that a teenager who rapes and assaults innocent people could have something in common with self-proclaimed 'civilised' people seems somehow both profane and incontrovertible.<br /><br />This is a book that people constantly feel the need to justify as good 'in spite of the violence'. While this istrue, it almost certainly misses the point of the inclusion of the violence. Burgess has stated on a number of occasions that 'A Clockwork Orange' also functions as an essay against violence, going as far as incorporating episodes from his own life into the novel. Also, so as not to disturb the intellectual palette of the novel, Burgess also uses Nadsat to distance the reader from the violence by inserting a stylistic lens.<br /><br />The Penguin Modern Classics edition contains a great Introduction by Blake Morrison that certainly enriched my understanding of the novel, although you may want to avoid spoilers by reading it after finishing the book.<br /><br />'A Clockwork Orange' is a book that will perhaps never enjoy mainstream adulation, but it certainly engenders enough potent opinions to earn remembrance for years to come. One of my favourite novels from the 20th century.",1

"The idea held some promise... The first thing I'll say is don't read this book if you want a really high quality story. You will be rather disappointed. Over all I enjoyed the story but I did find the plot extremely basic with manufactured romance and an obvious villain and I don't see how it was seen as an \\""""exquisitely drawn romance\\"""".<br /> I have to say I was a little mislead by the map contained within the first few pages of the book; I've usually found that most books that include a map of the world they are set in are well thought out and have copious painstaking detail, I'll state a famous example... The Lord of the Rings, and a more recent example The Black Magician trilogy and associated works. So I thought as I glanced over the map that maybe the author had managed to be concise as well as detailed. Unfortunately there was hardly any mention of the world the story is set in and it irritated me a little that the main cities were simply named after the king that resided in it. The little detail that is given about the setting was presented in such a way that I absorbed hardly any of it.<br />The characters themselves are also superficial, with more work Katsa could have been a wonderfully constructed character, and she has the potential to be one of those multifaceted characters with a tough outer shell and a deep complex interior. Instead she was a flat and contradictory character. From the first impressions of her she was tough but that seemed to disappear constantly when she would burst into tears for little reason, where a stronger person would have behaved in a completely different way.  I would have loved to see her sharp wit embellished on because it did give me the odd laugh out loud moment.<br />The romance is terribly predictable and I knew who the love interest would be by page ten, buy page eleven I had the gist of how their characters would play against each other.<br />I won't say outright that I didn't enjoy the book, served as an ok gap filler but it is unlikely I would want to read it again and again<br />The story has good potential and I really liked the idea of graces but Cashore painted it with a paint roller where she should have used a fine detail brush.ain and again  The story has good potential and I really liked the idea of graces but Cashore painted it with a paint roller where she should have used a fine detail brush.",0

"Caught in the psych age When it was made, 'Mr Fantasy' was probably considered a cutting-edge album from four fine musicians. The latter element is true, but I don't think it's aged well and the sound lacks vitality. 'No Face, No Name, No Number' is superb and, significantly, it's a slow, poignant song. But the flaws are evident on the opening track, 'Heaven Is In Your Mind'. That substance-influenced airiness of so much music of the late 1960s dominates, stifling the music. Jim Capaldi proves himself to be a fine percussionist on later albums, but here he lumbers along. After this, Traffic started making proper albums.",0

But - oh, dear.<br />There is scarcely a scene where the average six year would not snort in disbelief. Each and every episode doesn't stretch credibility to its breaking point - there is no credibility there in the first place.<br />The acting might get 2 stars. Photography 2 stars. Plot - you mean there is a plot?<br />The first few scenes were just ... boring. I kept on watching because I thought it must improve. It didn't.",0

They go on google earth and then pretend to have slushy sex again . A liitle more rubbish talking and then a little more rubbish sex .Is the russian girl an actress or a tennis player ? Did she have sex with her father ? The paper thin plot is boring too . Its like over hearing some ones conversation on a bus , you will never see them again and you dont care either .

"Americanah I have mixed feelings about this book, that is while I've had difficulties writing a review. For a Novel I think Americanah has failed but for a book about race, race and race... I think it is a good reference book for immigrants. As an Immigrant myself most of her observation are true, they are things I have seen or see happen to someone else. To me this book is not about love neither is it about hair the way the media is painting it. This book is about race and on this subject it is well written. Notice I did not call it a Novel it is a book a very good reference book for that reason I would give it 5 star.",1

What's the point of this film? Exactly what the title says - what's the point? Why make it? Its been done before so many times over and over. A monster destroys a city. And its always New York that gets destroyed. A stupid idea to completely ignore the start and finish of a film and think that just showing a section of the middle is great film making. Yes they will make another one which may or may not explain why the thing is there and where it came from. But again it will be another unoriginal film in a genre that has no fresh ideas. Most people may not care enough to want to go and see it. I'm one of them.,0

"Review EPL excellent, light reading.  the discussion on the first page is a bit of an  adjustment having to know that the husband of the author had to read that, it was not sensitive to him, so that lessened the credibility of the real choice to leave her marriage--like it was about other men or being available to, odd.  I think an Editor should be employed to cut the syndrome of TOO MUCH INFORMATIOn by authors that leave little to the imagination-- but we live in a blog culture that has influenced all writing.  i'm sure the author intended for honesty but her ex husband is out there and we were left thinking about the impact to him, as is the case with all those left in a marriage.",0

"Beautiful movie with great music This movie is beautiful looking and the sets are great but the story is garbage. Robert DeNiro over-acts as a womanising jerk (Jimmy Doyle) no one could care about.<br /><br />Minnelli also over-acts her part as DeNiros wife. She also looks terrible in the period wigs and costumes (and overweight in the second half), only looking comfortable at the very end when DeNiro is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br /> Scorsese tries so hard to create a 50s artificial atmosphere that Minnelli's scenes in front of an audience, where she would be electric in a real concert, the faked reactions take the energy out of the performances. It's his botch. In a strange way, it's a vanity film but for the director. Most embarrassing, he emphatically proves he's no Vincent Minnelli.<br /><br />Good thing about the DVD, you can skip to the good bits and lose the poor chemistry. Like a lot of Hollywood product, a huge waste....",0
I Wouldn't Waste Your Money! I bought this book without reading anything about it but saw that it had been nominated for an award so thought I'd give it ago. I wish I hadn't! I persisted and at some points I thought there was potential for a good story then it died again. There is too much psychology lingo which becomes incredibly grating and patronising.

dont waste your money. Danny cannot act. it is painful to see him try. they would have had more luck dressing a monkey.... from what i can see... they did. Sean was a great actor but now he has tainted his acting career with this embarrassment. every scene is full of historical inaccuracy's. it insults the brave Commandos of WW2 by depicting them in a sloppy careless mannor. The mission is completed far to easily with minimal resistance for such an important and secret objective. It then ends without completing the poorly excreted plot. Leaving the main actor Sean completely unaccounted for. Not to mention the typical German stereotypes that add to the hilarity of this trollop.  I suggest you save the £3 this abomination costs and invest in a hammer to spend your evening bludgeoning yourself to death with rather than watching this.  I only wish amazon would give a no star rating.,0
Five Stars It was great playing this on our record deck happy days,1
"Far inferior to the BBC original Can sum this up as far too little spread far too thin.  Production values are big bucks stuff, the script shines periodically but the gaps between such moments are wearisome indeed.  The original was high on theatrical presentation, this one thinks we're all so dumb that big names and lavish sets - along with glossy HD film stock - will make us all roll over and be really impressed.<br /><br />It's quantity over quality, in almost every area.  Especially in the sluggish direction and the flimsy threadbare way-overstretched plot lines.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey normally delivers decent midrange performances and he does more or less all that can be done with the lines here given him, but no Ian Richardson he. And there is never an opportunity to drag out scenes that is missed.  Over-lengthy cameras sliding away, vastly excessive use of TV soap opera style cut-scenes.  And asking its audience to believe that high level meetings and arguments are held in a tin shed over plates of BBQ rib, no matter how lip-smackin' they might be... it's an insult.<br /><br />For Spacey to follow Ian Richardson's chilling and utterly and convincingly evil F.U. is a bad mistake; the man just doesn't have what it would take to approach IR's ultra-Machiavellian Francis Urquhart.<br /><br />Often overlooked by reviews in the original was Colin Jeavons' portrayal of Stamper. His oily condescension, his reptilian stare, his deadly devotion to FU were all beautifully portrayed in the BBC production. Netflix's Stamper is a pale and neutral sort of creature in comparison, all of which more or less serves as an example of what the English production got exactly correct - and the US version got more or less exactly wrong.<br /><br />If this were condensed by roughly two thirds, extraneous and unproductive plot lines axed, and numerous peripheral characters dumped, then the core values of the series would become far easier to focus on and maintain interest.<br /><br />However, credit where it's due. The photography is outstanding, the scenery is lavish and very convincing. The sound quality is also very high.  It's a shame that these skin-deep features can't breathe more life into its limp scripts and bloated screen times.<br /><br />Overall, three stars is a bit of a stretch given how good it could have been if they'd chosen to learn from the original.  But given how often US soap programmes have offered up this sort of stuff and been runaway successes, this one may be similarly successful.",0

"Sex & Drags & Wreck n Roll (Part 2) Quentin Tarantino's `5th' film Death Proof was originally conceived as the second part of a `Grindhouse' double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The idea was to replicate the 70's exploitation movie experience of low budget shclock opera's, where the posters are better than the actual films, and which have clearly been such a huge influence on both filmmakers - missing reels, scratched celluloid, gate hairs, tacky trailers and kitsch corporate graphics all to an ear splitting trumpet-loaded soundtrack. It certainly took me back to the pre-multiplex days of my childhood when audiences had enough of an attention span to watch two films back to back with barely a moment in between to restock on Embassy No10's and another carton of Kia-Ora.<br /><br /> I saw the original Grindhouse `double bill' version in New York back in April, and appreciated it for the great bit of self indulgence it is on the part of the directors who should be in the happy position of being able to make the movies they want without having to worry too much about box office returns and studio interference. Unfortunately somewhere in the crossfire of a Mexican standoff between the producers, marketing department, distributors and the directors themselves Grindhouse has been mutilated, Black Dahlia-like, and unceremoniously dumped in two halves on U.K audiences. Although reviews were good, Grindhouse flopped in the states, so, with what appears to be a case of contagious cold feet tippy-toeing their way across the Atlantic, our distributors have decided that we're incapable of handling the Grindhouse experience in its entirety - hence releasing Tarantino's half as his 5th film.<br /><br />Death Proof is an intentionally slight tale of psychopathic `Stuntman Mike' (Kurt Russell) who gets his kicks causing car crashes in his specially designed `death proof' Chevy Nova (and later a Dodge Charger) in which everyone except himself is killed. After targeting yet another group of nubile young girls as his next victims the tables are turned and Stuntman Mike becomes the subject of their bloody revenge.<br /><br />  Considering the promise of mucho car-nage that the premise suggests Death Proof is dialogue heavy; but then one line of Tarantino's dialogue is more action packed than all of Diesel, Seagal and Van Damme's `roid' fests put together - and when the violence does descend, it falls hard. But isolated from the Grindhouse concept, Death Proof pales besides the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. A 127 minute re-cut of the movie was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May in an attempt to bring it up to the standard of Tarantino's other outings and this, I believe, is the version U.K audiences are about to witness.<br /><br /> Unfortunately the faux-trailers of `forthcoming attractions' such as 'Machete', 'Hobo with a Shotgun' and 'Werewolf Women of the S.S' (with Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu!) which split the original Grindhouse version are not included. This sequence was the highlight of the whole movie and I know I'm not the only one who hoped that they would actually turn some of these spoofs into real films. It's looking doubtful that the original Grindhouse double bill version will be shown in the U.K and even more annoying that the DVD releases of both films are not to feature the trailers either. (Apart from 'Machete' in Planet Terror) Death proof is one thing - but film industry proof?

"No rigour and not much vigour... I enjoy this album for what it is: film music (mostly) played on the piano with a comparative absence of trickery... comparative, that is, to the obligatory bombast of the original production scores; but also to Sakamoto's electronic oeuvre. And let's be clear that - despite his reputedly hypnotic playing style -  there is no way that the ageing Japanese wunderkind could get through all the tracks here on a pub piano without either a computer chip or Doc Octopus as an assistant.    This is emotional music for people who like to think about emotion and feel music: rather than the other way around.     So - since no one else is - let's be brutal. Sakomoto is not Chopin. He offers nothing like the Polish master's complexity and has done nothing to match his historical achievement. He's not 'even' Debussy (who Sakomoto rightly admires). You might say he combines Erik Satie's molasses stride with Modest Mussorgsky's chordal enthusiasm. In fact Mussorgsky makes a neat comparison: someone soused in nationalist harmonics, whose compositions only achieve their potential when they're transposed.    Many a performer would envy Sakomoto's delightful effects and many a composer would want his ear for melodic 'hooks': but you can buy lemon meringues that have got more structure than these works have - and although structure for its own sake is a conservative vice, it is also a pretty infallible measure of thought and imagination. The suspicion has to be that this cd release was a bit of a money-earner ('Merry Xmas Mr Lawrence' AGAIN?!) by a man anxious to buff up his posterity before the arrival of arthritis.     Which doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. Just keep a sense of proportion. After all, most of that squelchy stuff is in our hearts, not in the plastic - and it does us no dishonour.",0

"Disappointing, but still Linkin Park To be frank this album wasn't very good in my opinion. As a listener and long time fan since their d&eacute;but album Hybrid Theory in 2000, I found this album very disappointing.<br />While listening it felt like it was rushed and lacked passion. Chester Bennington's voice in particular was lacking.<br />I found many songs to be boring and repetitive. However there are a few tracks which I find to be highlights to my listening experience;<br /><br />- Rebellion (ft. Daron Malakian)<br />- Keys to the Kingdom<br />- War<br />- All for Nothing (ft. Page Hamilton)<br />- Guilty all the Same<br /><br />If I was to rank this against their other albums, it would go like this;<br />1. Hybrid Theory<br />2. A Thousand Suns<br />3. Meteora<br />4. Living Things<br />5. &#62;Hunting Party&#60;<br />6. Minutes to Midnight<br /><br />Other than that I was seriously tempted to illegally download this album before buying it (I believed it wasn't even worth my money), but I still remain a supporter (stupidly) of Linkin Park and I think they should be very lucky to have someone like me buying their albums after all this time.<br /><br />To Linkin Park: Please make some interesting music. A lot of your Underground CDs and unreleased songs are actually much better than the songs you decide to put on your albums. Please, Linkin Park, please... while you still have any dignity (you're holding onto it by a very thin string!), please do better on your next album.",0

"Mid-tempo music that falls between too many genres I listened to this twice and thought it was a bit bland.  Jazz inflected music that was neither pop enough, rock enough, singer-songwriter enough or even jazzy enough to be jazz itself.  It didn't have any strong melodies and I quickly forgot all the songs on this short 33 minute album.    I listened to it again for the first time in a few weeks to see if a bit of time has been kind to it.  The songs have not become any more pronounced, or any more memorable than they were before.    It's not bad music but it is a bit too bland and relentlessly mid-tempo to be something I would recommend.",0

"RUBBING OUR NOSES IN IT Like ice-like fire, Bob Dylan still attracts attention. I remember being among the tie-dyed congregation on The Isle of Wight at the end of August 1969 to see him in flame; as I remember the fire in Paris that engulfed the bank known as the Credit Lyonnais. In photographs of the time provided as part of this attractive package Dylan looks as soft and innocent as old Bradley Manning before he died recently and was so swiftly born again.<br /><br />It brings back memories to actually buy an album. These days there really is no need to pay. Do I devalue this package by pulling on the acetate seal and losing the lovat blue label that says “2 Disc Set Features 35 Rarities and Previously Unreleased Recordings from Historic 1969-1971 era”? Do I devalue this presentation by playing it?  Such concerns are uppermost in the mind of those who, like me, bought the first three Dylan LPs; fortunately in mono. The music, so easy to download for free, perhaps I should leave it as it is?<br /><br />The archival little booklet says that my original “double album” was released in June 1970. I would have been one of the first to buy it. According to Wikipedia, Dylan had, at around that time, realised that his manager, Albert Grossman was taking 50% of all his song-writing royalties and Dylan was only able to cancel the contractual arrangements in July 1970.  This is evidence enough that Bob, turning on Grossman, determined not to write anything more that might give the man, to whom he owed the most,  another cent. “All the Tired Horses” and “Wigwam” to say nothing of “Woogie Boogie” must have broken poor Albert’s heart. Dylan was thinking about money for a change. For this ingratitude we know, with hindsight, that the muse withdrew from her favourite and punished Dylan sorely. There have been some sublime isolated songs when the muse herself must have felt forlorn and took him once more by the hand; but since 1967 there has been nothing to match the quality of theunbroken string of albums that had gone before. Self Portrait was an attempt to assault CBS and deprive Grossman of any commission.<br /><br />Despite this the album was a success. My CD booklet opens with a copy of a CBS poster boasting that this album would be in a million homes. It went on to sell three million copies.  Dylan could do no wrong even towards Grossman.<br /><br />Between “John Wesley Harding” in 1967 and “Blood on the Tracks” 1975 was a long time; for those who’d come to expect a groundbreaking piece of work every year since “Freewheeling”.  “Nashville Skyline” had been given its “world premiere” on Radio Luxembourg with Kid Jensen, aged about six, introducing “I Threw It All Away”; and over two days I taped the four tracks they showcased. The next highlight in 1969 was the arrival of “Don’t Look Back” in the UK.  Lying on a mattress, I saw the film projected onto a sheet pinned to the wall of the Drury Lane Arts Lab. I was there at The Isle of Wight at the end of August 1969. If you are prepared to pay £75, as an extra you can have the whole of this concert, albeit in the wrong order, for the first time; plus the original Self Portrait “remastered”. Yamaha used to sell their exquisite guitars to young people but now only successful dentists purchase them. It is these, navigators of the root canal rather than Paths of Victory, who are targeted by “collector’s items”. Fools and innocents like Dylan, and their money, are soon parted..<br /><br />The new album is interesting and reminds me of what I was playing 44 years ago but the only track I want to play over and over again is “Thirsty Boots” written by Eric Andersen; but the version I’m playing is that with 7104 views (as I write) on YouTube which, with its piano accompaniment, has the edge. I guess Dylan was trying to say from a sincere heart: that he was not the only song-writer in the world.<br /><br />With hindsight the highlight of that warm, famous and dark August evening when Dylan played at the Isle of Wight was the crowd calling out the word “DOCTOR!” to Ricky Farr.  Farr had been our master of ceremonies for the three days, who usually caught the attention of us all assembled there with the word “People!” After Dylan’s execrable performance: “People ! He really has gone!” was the last thing we heard before that whole wasteland was aflame and we made our way from the fire to the ferries. There had been a good-natured wait of three hours after The Band’s set before Dylan appeared. Not far from me (I’m sure that every person there with a memory like mine would remember it this way, “not far from me”) a girl was stricken with appendicitis and a few of her desperate companions, and those nearby, started calling out for a doctor.  In that morass there were no mobile phones.  It was too dark for smoke signals.  In the end the whole crowd called out the word until, for Mr Farr, the penny dropped and with uncharacteristic insight he asked only those near the sick girl to call out.  Soon the ambulance men were on their way from Desolation Row.  Though we didn’t know it then, the show was over.  Biographies of Dylan have established that the three hour wait was because Albert Grossman, also managing The Band and Richie Havens, insisted on being paid Dylan’s fee £30,000 in CASH; and Ricky Farr and his associates were reduced to calling it in from the hot dog stands.<br /><br />In Paris, so long ago now, when that bank was on fire, there was an English couple who’d tired of viewing the conflagration. In that Gallic company they could speak loudly in English with no fear of being overheard. “Care for a spot of lunch?” the Englishman said.",0

"RED Red is simply a fun trashy film. No real story, no great set ups and no big agenda. Just unabashed action. Bringing a group of older actors together to battle a big bad corporation is nothing overly new. However the casting choices here are fun and interesting.<br /><br />Typically we have Bruce Willis chewing his lip and looking pensive at every opportunity. So far so  predictable, but with choices like John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman the crew take on a sudden manic joy that wasn't expected. They trot out all the usual action lines and zip around firing their oversized weapons with aplomb.<br /><br />The action is thick and fast and the story over blown, but what more do you really want?<br /><br />Nothing special then, but a laugh all the same.",0

"Whats that all about? I bought this book about 8 months ago and only got around to reading it recently. It came highly recommended to me by a number of people who had read it.  I must confess that when I had got over the idea that I had to like it, I realised that it just didn't live up to expectations at all. The premise of the book is good. It tells the a story of how the War affected ordinary German citizens. It debunks the myth that everyone in Germany during the war was a Nazi sympathiser, and and that overnight they all became \\""""bad\\"""" people. This is interesting and a subject that I think deserves more attention from writers in general. But the book is badly constructed. It's deficiencies are added to by a bizarre narration by \\""""Death\\"""",which is intensely annoying as almost every chapter he has a litle diatribe about the meaning of certain words or little clues about who is going to die when and also at times it's like he is addressing the narration to children and talks in a patronising way. I also felt that some of the main charachters were scarcely believable. They just don't behave the way kids of that age behave. They are heavily laden with pointless idiosyncracies. There are good points to the book as well and I found the grown up charachters to be a little more believable. But the fact that every piece of dialogue ends with the words \\""""saumench\\"""" or \\""""saukerl\\"""" or \\""""arschloch\\"""" is extremely irritating. It's a shame, without the \\""""Narrator\\"""", with a little more realism injected into the child charachters, I think that the book could have gone somewhere important. As it is I can't really say that I enjoyed it. To be fair to the author, his ability is not in question, although I haven't read any of his other books it is obvious that he has what it takes. I just think he made a few executive decisions regarding this book which didn't work out.    A far better book I felt was The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. A similar story, told from an unusual viewpoint. About one third the size of this book, but gets the message across far more effectively and leaves a longer lasting impression.",0
"Oh My  What a """"lengthy"""" waste of paper I rarely write reviews, and have never written one for a book before but I wanted to help tip the scales against the hype surrounding this novel.  I must admit I was curious about this book - with all the hype and I was pleased when I was given this book as a birthday gift.  At least I have the satisfaction that it wasn't my money wasted on this boring book.<br />I had been pre-warned that things don't \\""""get going\\"""" until around Chapter 9.  I think I would of given up before then if not - as it was I was skipping pages.  I found both main characters rather wooden and unbeleivable for a start, Christians apparently successful business career is almost as unbelievable as Ana's innocence.  Are we really supposed to beleive this successful, rich and apparently well experienced man fell for innocent, plain Ana after just one meeting??!  Some classic literature is referred to in the book but I can only assume the author herself hasn't read any, due to her limited vocabulary.  (If I read the words \\""""Oh My\\"""" again it will be too soon).  As for the erotisism - even that got repetative, I personaly haven't read any other erotic novels - so have nothing to compare this too but I would imagine there are far more explicit novels out there, if that's what you're looking for.  It reads like the author looked a few things up on the internet and added a few comments rather than having any proper knowledge on the subject.<br /><br />I did read it to the end - but only to try and understand what all the fuss has been about.  I feel cheated by all the hype and I'm quite unable to understand how this novel got to have such a huge following.  I just hope the film that's been rumoured never gets made!",0
Interesting subject. Friends have liked this a lot but because it is all correspondence ands it never really took  my attention and I soon gave up.,0

"If i'd only known! Oh dear, if I'd known it is so easy to write a Bestseller, I would be rich by now! And alas! She even made 3 of them!<br /><br />So here's the recipe for everyone interested:<br />1) First (and most important!): Decide which basic words/phrases to use (not more than 5) and repeat them continuously (just some examples: exasperating, murmur, good point well made, ...)<br />2) Choose two dull characters who fall in love head over heals (no preamble needed)<br />3) boring sex, boring sex, boring sex, ... (always mention sex in a book, sex sells! Repeat at will, don't forget the inner goddess)<br />4) No plot whatsoever<br />5) Repeat that about 50 times, divided in as many chapters as you like<br />6) Avoid good editors at all costs!!!<br /><br />Well, I have to say, the book cover is very nice (so the one star goes to this). But usually authors don't have anything to do with book covers, hm...<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me, I have to copy and paste my new Bestseller about someone doing something maybe with another person in a city.

"A standard hollywood blockbuster that happens to be set in the star trek universe. Well, what a disappointing film. Somewhere, in the impenetrable mists of hollywood, a producer has decided to churn out yet another action film, but stuck the label of star trek to it to appeal to an already existing fan base on the simple assumption that they will watch it for a few familiar faces and references, conveniently saving any necessary effort on plot, characterisation or world building. This is the product of that decision.<br />I actually had difficulty believing that a director of JJ Abram's calibre directed this. It is a poor written mess with a nonsensical plot, virtually non existent characters, who only seem to bear a familiar name and look, existing more as caricatures of themselves than characters in their own right. The film's pace is relentless, leaving absolutely no time for thought or human interaction( although this may mean that the viewer might miss some of the glaring plot holes), and even the effects are unimpressive, for the fact that no time is ever given to bind the visuals to the live action in a cohesive fashion, and most of the shots are far to fast to actually take in or appreciate them, adding even more to the rushed feel of the film. The live action sequences are average at best, and feel quite disjointed, especially as the enterprise seems to consist of three rooms and one interconnecting corridor, and the sheer amount of lens flares in almost every scene  are exceptionally annoying. Most of them appear to have been added deliberately as well, although I cannot fathom the reason. Maybe to distract from the lack of, well, anything that could have made this film watchable. To make matters worse is the complete lack of realism. I'm not a star trek fan and cannot comment on the realism of the series or any previous film, but the plot involves magical interplanetary teleportation that renders starships obsolete, magic blood that can cure death, a ship that can hop across the galaxy in seconds, be interrupted in mid warp and still appear within spitting distance of Earth, and then conveniently fight a battle which no one notices. I'm not asking for a century spent in cold sleep between stars here, but seriously, the lack of realism is ridiculous to the point of making myself burst out laughing at the sheer silliness of it all. It will probably be remembered alongside the now legendary lizard man fight from the very early days of start trek, but not for at least twenty years. Renting for a watch with a few drunk friends is probably the best use at the moment.pear within spitting distance of Earth, and then conveniently fight a battle which no one notices.

"Cheap and very disappointing Really disappointed by this. The CD is a single track, so I my son wants to hear a specific song we have to fast forward through which is hideous if you want to find a song in the middle. The tracks are very poor, most have no musical accompaniment and are just Peppa singing on her own, hideously out of tune! The CD isn't very long, and is padded out by each song being played twice.<br /><br />The book itself is quite flimsy too!<br /><br />I associate the Peppa brand with quality, and this is far from that. It's useless as a car CD for example as the tunes are short, out of tune and trying to find an individual track very tricky.<br /><br />A waste of money for us I'm afraid!",0

"2012 Collected Edition I have been a casual fan of comics for years.  Alan Moore, Mike Mignola, Grant Morrison being my staple diet.  I have only recently got into Batman and have LOVED Grant Morrison's run, Jeff Loeb's work is great, and of course the Frank Miller stuff is superb.<br /><br />Having heard the bits of Knightfall - Broken Bat are used in the new Batman film, i thought i would give it a go and stumped up the cash for this bumper collected edition.<br /><br />I would agree with other reviewers that this doesnt have the depth of other comic writers.  The art is ok, and didnt bother me at all.  It was just the story writing.  It seemed lazy and didnt inspire me to want to read any more.  I cant put my finger on what it is exactly, maybe i have been spoiled by far superior writers.  There was little if any character development and the whole thing felt rather lack-lustre.

"Lou Reed and Metallica - The odd couple Honestly, it is not for the want of trying, three straight listens in a row (each 87 minutes passed very slowly), a copy in the car and headphones. There are obviously many Amazon reviewers out there who love this album ​and respect for that. But in this humble abode, this CD is in real danger of becoming the most expensive coffee coaster of modern times. In 1967, Lou Reed wrote lines which stunned Andy Warhol and which energised thousands of aspiring musicians to start bands. Remember &#34;Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather/Whiplash girlchild in the dark/Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him/Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart&#34;? Can this be the same poet who today writes &#34;I'm a woman who likes men, a little dog with a puny body and tiny dick, I AM A TABLE&#34;.<br /><br />For the record, no one doubts the genius of Metallica. Their &#34;Black Album&#34; should be worshipped at the shrine of rock music and given to your Granny to free her from Andre Rieu. Lou Reed's career equally is an exemplary of uncompromising grumpy brilliance with the occasional large misstep. But this reviewer can happily declare that the excruciating &#34;Metal Machine Music&#34; is better than Lulu. In the last analysis, this whole bloated mess collapses in on itself in the 19-minute finale of the truly horrible &#34;Junior Dad&#34; where you wish Nicolas Parsons would intervene and just shout &#34;repetition&#34;. One positive note emerges from &#34;Lulu&#34; namely that Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead must now relinquish their long-held title of the worst collaboration in rock music history.",0
Three Stars Disappointed with this. S B 's does a lot of cover versions which did not bear comparison.,0
"A similar pattern Steven Moffat, having taken over the lead writer position on Dr. Who, turned a five-star programme into something mediocre because his scripts, and those he approved by the other writers on the team, are all superficial and sport gaping holes in logic. The last series of DW was on a par with its dreadful last days back in the eighties when Sylvester McCoy was in the leading role, before it was cancelled - let's hope Moffat does not kill it to that extent.    Here, once again, Moffat has worked on something which holds tremendous promise (in the case of Dr. Who, he inherited that promise from Russell T. Davies and then squandered it), but once again the production falls far short of its full potential because of superficial scripts. This is an enormous pity because the lead actors in Sherlock are amazingly talented and, with the right material, could have truly shone. Sherlock is saved only because it borrows heavily from Conan Doyle's original stories; had they been entirely Moffat ideas the whole thing would have completely crashed and burned. How does this guy garner so much respect when his writing abilities are clearly average (with a couple of notable exceptions)? My one wish is that Sherlock had been devised by someone other than Moffat. The work of Conan Doyle and Dr. Who are two things I was raised on and enjoyed immensely. It's a shame to see them reduce to drivel in this way.",0

"I blame Rick Rubin Follow-up albums are notoriously difficult. But when I read that Rick Rubin was producing this I was reassured. After all he had done such great work with Johnny Cash, allowing the Man in Black's voice to carry simple, unfussy arrangements. Surely he would do the same with Jake Bugg? Jake's voice is just as individual as Johnnie's. All you have to do is let the lyrics and the voice carry the emotion. No - Rick Rubin has chosen to drown out the subtle nuances of Jake's performance with ear-splitting percussion and driving beats. What was he thinking? Take the drums off this record and slow it down and you've got a very reasonable second album. Compare the track 'Pine Trees' which doesn't have drums on with any other and enjoy the difference. Ironically, listen how the lovely beginning to 'Simple Pleasures' is ruined when the overpowering percussion comes in. Rick should have taken his production theme from this track's title. Go back to the production values of your first album Jake.",0

"I really tried......but, no. Not wanting to feel I was missing out on something good, especially when its been compared to Harry Potter and The Da Vinci Code? NOT! I read the first and last book of the 'famous' triology. Sorry but the writing is just awful, weak and rambling. I truly wanted to love the book like the rest of the world it seems, but couldn't. I skimmed through the final couple of chapters totally bored, just hoping to get a 'bit of an ending?\\"""" NO. I really would love to know 'the' ending ie Mr Grey's childhood, but without all the dribble in between as I am not going to waste my money on the other two books. I am not a prude I like some sex scenes in my reading, but these were beyond believe. If anyone wants an erotic classic with REAL writing look now further than D H Lawrence, Lady Chatterley's Lover.",0

"Magical, Spellbinding, Instant Classic Read this review along with others on my blog by following this link: https://bibliomad.wordpress.com/<br /><br />Electric, magic, and utterly spellbinding, Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane takes fantasy to a whole new level. This novel crafts a fantastical take on 1970s Sussex, England in a style I've never seen nor heard of before. I've never read  stand-alone fantasy novel before, nor have I read a Neil Gaiman novel before, but I feel this was a great place to start.<br /><br />The novel begins in the prologue (obviously), where in our nameless protagonist is an adult, and is visiting Hempstock Farm - a place he recalls from his childhood - in order to escape a funeral; who's funeral, we are not told. The epilogue is told from this perspective also. The man, whom I'm assuming is about 47, knows only that his pull to Hempstock Farm is generally caused by his pull to Lettie Hempstock. However, the magic binding the farm, makes it so that when he's on the farm, he can remember the truth, yet when he's away, all is forgotten. The rest of the book is written from the same man's perspective, yet when he was 7 years old. It is here that his true story with Lettie Hempstock is recalled, and the magic begins.<br /><br />Personally, I believe the ambiguity adds to the magical feel the story already possesses. It makes it so that you're looking through the mind of a 47-year-old, trying to remember things that happened 40 years prior. Thus, the ambiguity makes it more realistic, and - in being rough around the edges - more interesting, too. This story keeps you guessing, and some of the vague aspects allow you to create your own interpretation of what is happening, and why. Also, the fact that the protagonist is nameless, as are his sister and parents, make it feel much more personal, as if you're the one reminiscing, and not a random 47-year-old man we know little about.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is a lot of symbolism in this book, generally relating to the disconnection between adults and children, but also to inner-darkness, I would say. It's nice, because the whole novel is coming from a 47-year-old's memory, and so there's the direct juxtaposition of an adult and a child, and how both progress through the novel. Likewise, there's also the contrast of childhood naivety and universe-old wisdom, teaching both lessons to the protagonist, and to the reader.<br /><br />On another note, I adore the cover of this book! The sparkles and the misty blue give it a magical aura, as does the light coming from above. Covers like this make me sad I'm a kindle user, because this is definitely a book I would display.<br /><br />Generally, this novel takes you on a quick journey to a fantasy land, before dropping you suddenly back into reality. It's almost as if you've been given access to a little snippet of someone's mind, which I really enjoyed. Despite this being an adult-targeted novel, I do believe it will appeal to people from multiple age groups. For example, I can imagine I child being read this as a bed-time story just as well as I can imagine an elderly man reading this on the train. Hence, I gave this book 4/5 stars, and would definitely recommend to everyone, even those not so keen on fantasy.e disconnection between adults and children, but also to inner-darkness, I would say.

"Cliched and lack of plot Film reviews are always a matter of opinion, just as this one will be. I heard great things about this film and decided to get it on Blu-ray. Big mistake and definately not worth it on this (rather expensive) format.    Maggie Grace (Lost) plays the girl who got kidnapped, and her acting as a 17 year old is dire. The actress herself being 25 years old makes it so unbelievable that you cannot take her seriously. Liam Neeson, on the other hand, is always good; but a poor script and almost non-existant plot keep him from becoming anything more than an actor that doesn't really care about his film. And I'm not entirely sure what his accent is supposed to be. This man was Oscar Schlinder for crying out loud, now he is reduced to roles like this?!    Finally, the story itself raises some odd questions, it makes out that Europe is an extremely dangerous place for anyone, and that we should all stay in America and never leave. I don't think I have ever seen a film as xenophobic as this.    But when it comes down to it, if you want a film with violence and action, this is it. Just don't expect anything else.",0

"Pretentious and empty, not even entertaining. When a French movie is good, it is really good. But French cinema, unfortunately, is often empty, pretentious, with a hollow grandeur that is really pitible. That is the case here, in my opinion. It is a horror movie that pretends to be phylosophical; the mixture doesn't work, and it is neither one or the other. The horror is repetitive, déjà vu, and the \\""""phylosophy\\"""" is simply preposterous. The result is an empty film that fails to be even entertaining. One of those French movies that keeps turning around its belly button...gee, to see the airs of the director in the extras, as if he were David Cronenberg's grandfather...(I have the French release, don't know about the extras in the UK version).",0
"A shocking rip-off So here we have mastadon - now one of the biggest metal bands on the planet<br /><br />And what do we have here with 'the hunter'? why - nothing less than the most shameful and disgraceful collection of rip offs ive heard since oasis<br /><br />The band in question they are ripping off? Why - it should be plain to anybody with a modicum of knowledge about music (which obviously not many have) - The masters of reality<br /><br />This album is an unbelievable steal from chris goss and company. Mastadon have obviously been listening very carefully. But while the masters wallow in third division cult-land where they dont deserve to be, these pretenders have stolen their music and got huge on the back of it<br /><br />The most blatant example on here would be 'the creature lives' which im sure, if chris goss heard it, would have him running for the phone to call his lawyer. if anyone knows chris, please - tell him about this album<br /><br />Mastadon - you should be ashamed of yourselves. As for those of you who rate this - i suggest you go buy the masters of reality back catalogue and educate yourselves as to whats really going on here",0

I would agree with the critics that there is not enough 'story' for the length of the film and the wolves talking to each other was just really weird.  I can't see why it was such a shock to everyone (esp with a father in law who's a Dr) that Bella got pregnant but well it's not real life is it and the honeymoon scenery was gorgeous, I want to go there.

"Not merely overrated This book, like the later Saturday, suffers the usual McEwan faults:  a lack of human insight is the biggest obstacle, since he tends always to externalise suffering and pain in the 'the other' who is never comprehended, only a menacing figure to be shunned.  This also leads to the chilly tone and static quality of his work since none of his characters have any real inner dynamic, which requires a degree of ambivalence McEwan cannot muster.  I find his prose, also, prissy and self satisfied, yet the cool technical perfection no doubt appeals, and reinforces his reputation as a major writer.  For the record, the reputation is unfounded:  he is not and never will be a major writer, lacking the basic equipment, the soul, needed to excel.  This is the work of someone lost in the world.  Because of the inherent mediocrity of the books themselves McEawn's reputation has to be defended by force, by bullying.  When John Banville wrote a negative review of 'Saturday' he was hounded and bullied in the London press.  Likewise, the same is now happening to the Mail on Sunday journalist who raised questions about this book's originality (A serious point when someone sells themselves to the public as a deep, original mind and become wealthy in the process) - a vindictive campaign organised by the writer's powerful friends, friends who are very well placed across journalism, literature and academia.  We cannot have a literary culture, a literary debate, in a climate of fear in which careers are destroyed for daring to criticise one person.  McEwan and his allies are doing just this and it needs to be exposed;  more, it needs to be stopped.",0
"Gap Yah for Grown-Ups As a student of Italian, Elizabeth Gilbert has taught me a lot of new useful Italian phrases. That said, this is all she has taught me during the course of what I can quite honestly say is one of the most solipsistic, self-indulgent, over-hyped memoirs I have ever read; a book which myself and a good friend laughed our way through during the course of a week in Florence.    Firstly, Gilbert makes some truly staggering statements. At one point she says that \\""""36 percent of Italian children have an allergy to the gluten needed to make pasta, pizza and bread, so there goes Italian culture\\"""". For Gilbert, the entire of Italian culture from the fall of the Roman empire to now seems to boil down to one word: PIZZA. This assertion only accompanies other, equally ridiculous, cultural stereotypes played out throughout the memoir. Moreover, her sojourn in Italy - in being centred on food - seems to miss the focus of much of the beauty that country has to offer. In fact, she quits her Italian language classes because they are interfering with the Elizabeth Gilbert School of Italian, i.e. Operation Carbs.    Gilbert, the queen of sweeping generalisations, charactrises Sicily as a third world country (\\""""dreadful poverty\\"""" etc. etc.), compares her own emotional plight to life in a Russian Gulag and seems to view the island of Bali as some sort of majestical spiritual paradise.    In parts Eat, Pray, Love reads more like a work of fiction than a memoir. Many of the 'characters' Gilbert encounters are one-dimensional and riddled with stereotypes. Furthermore, whilst surely everyone understands that divorce must be a traumatic experience, I personally feel there isn't quite such a need to harp on about it for a few lines every second page, especially when said divorce seems to arise from nothing more than ennui, leading to my main gripe about this book - its repetitive nature. Section Two, India, appears to make up a series of confused and obscure spiritual ramblings which are neither remotely interesting nor remotely enlightening. Overall, this book is about commitment issues, whether religious or romantic.    I would urge people not to bother picking up this book. It reminds me, rather ironically, of the famous spoof video about a certain class of young person going on their 'Gap Yah' (gap year); a video which sends up western ideas of a \\""""political, social and cultural exchange\\"""" which is \\""""sooooo enlightening, darling\\"""".

"The ending spoilt it for me Another book club choice and one made by me !  I enjoyed the blurb and thought it would make for a lively discussion but it was not a favourite with the group.  I stayed with it up to a point but there were too many glaring inconsistencies for me.  Our Heroine was so isolated from the start that it wasn't long before alarm bells started to ring and the twist at the end was no real surprise because of this.  However the real disappointment for us all was the lame 'happy ever after' ending, it was as if the author was so tired at the end of writing that she just scribbled down 'and they lived happily ever after' even though this scenario was highly improbable given that her romantic other half had been nowhere to be seen for all those years.  I'm giving it 3 stars but its probably more of a 2.5 because of the happy ending.",0
"Superb listen and I will again and again ad infinitum, as I discover more with each listen. This album I bought because I am a Floyd fan, who was introduced to their music by a friend who let me listen to 'Wish You Were Here' in 1975, then I heard 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and immediately bought it. I've loved all their albums in the main, but found the 'DIvision Bell' not so much to my liking. So, as 'Endless River' is made up of a lot material around that time, I wondered what the result would be. I needn't have, 'Endless' had me by the first note, and you could immediately tell that this was mainly a Richard Wright heavily influenced track, with it's wispy feel. It just leads you into an album that is sumptuous and just keeps you glued for the ride. I never found one track I could fault, and I can be picky. But David Gilmour and Nick Mason can be justly proud of their tribute the late great Richard Wright, for who this album will be lasting legacy, and a must for your collection, even if you are not a die hard Floyd fan.",1

"Hollywood as an instrument of American contemporary history. Not only does this movie go some way to normalising torture in the name of the righteous, special and exceptional country but, worse than this, its very dull. You can sense that the director begins to become aware of this and throws in some petrochemical explosions occasionally to spark things up a bit. The acting is standard American-school and the characters are off-the-shelf and grossly overstated. The tension is maintained by people shouting at each other.<br />I'm glad I rented it, for one dollar, else I'd be really miffed. I only did so because I wanted to see it before joining the debate on it.<br />In real life Obama has gone from flat denial that America was torturing anyone to &#34;...sure, we tortured some folks&#34;.

"Faded purple Deep Purple's debut album lies on the border between psychedelia and the band's future in hard rock. 'And The Address' is a pounding instrumental which looks more to the future and allows Ritchie Blackmore to flex his prowess on guitar, though his solos sometimes spiral into the clouds rather than fit in with what his bandmates are playing. 'Hush' is one of four covers and easily the most worthwhile, being not just a hit but a song they made their own. Of the other covers, Skip James's 'I'm So Glad' had already been done well by Cream and DP's version follows in their slipstream. They try to take 'Help' into a different area, but only succeed in bending it out of shape with a slow, ponderous treatment. And did the world need yet another version of 'Hey Joe'? Most bands short of original material covered this, while others rewrote it in their own image. 'One More Rainy Day' is a remnant of psych pop featuring some neat baroque organ work from Jon Lord, a good example of the genre, but a little out of place here. 'Prelude: Happiness' is oddly titled, sounding menacing rather than happy, though it points toward the band's later music. 'Mandrake Root' has a similar groove to 'And The Address' and is the albums most experimental song, featuring a few twists and turns. 'Love Help Me' is lighter and relatively weak. 'Shades Of Deep Purple' is, then, dated and an ill-fitting collection of styles, but contains some of the dynamism DP displayed so much of later.",0

"Fist album was better In her first album 'Birdy', she covered a lot of songs by others and made them better (like Skinny Love, People help the people, etc). In this first album you heard the wide rage of intonations her voice could make.<br />As a singer-songwriter however, she still has to grow. In most of the songs, she uses only a limited scale of her voice, which is much more flexible than shown on this album. But she can sing of course, but the power results in the broad range of intonations and she omit to use this in her own songs. A missed chance",0

"Such atrocities Even though this book is about the Holocaust and Auschwitz, it is told through the eyes of a 9 year old german boy and hence cultivates a lighter and more innocent `fable-like' approach to the atrocities that occurred. The boy, having no friends of his own to play with outside of Auschwitz, befriends a young jewish boy in the camp and what ensues is a friendship that destroys ethnic and religious boundaries and which ends in a final, cruel twist of fate.",1

"The Emperor has no clothes Just to reassure ADS123 that he's not the only small boy pointing out the emperor's nudity.    I approached this book with great anticipation. Not just a Pulitzer winner (I'm seldom disappointed), but with a recommendation from Marilynne Robinson (one of my favourite authors) on the cover.    So, two stars because of my level of disappointment. This is a collection of short(ish) writing exercises in quasi-poetic form masquerading as a novel. A novel needs some narrative and character development; poetry needs precision. This book offers neither. Yes, there are passages of felicitous phrase-making, but too often we're offered out-of-context pieces of flashy wordsmithing put into the minds or mouths of characters ill-suited to such expression. There's also much post-modern trickery (long single-sentence sections, pointless changes in person and voice, magical realism bolt-ons).    Just occasionally the Pulitzer committee succumbs to Oscars syndrome. Just as showy performing sometimes triumphs over acting, so creative writing virtuosity sometimes triumphs over novel writing. Sadly, this is one of those occasions.    If you're looking for truly poetic story-telling, I suggest that you avoid this book and try Annie Dillard's \\""""The Maytrees\\"""", Tove Jansson's \\""""The Summer Book\\"""" or anything by Marilynne Robinson.     One final complaint, not against the author (I hope) but against the publisher. As usual nowadays, there are several typos throughout the book, including transpositions (\\""""of off\\"""" instead of \\""""off of\\"""") and homophone errors (\\""""teaming\\"""" for \\""""teeming\\""""). I see more and more of this in recently-published books. In novels such as this, that claim some level of poeticism, it's unforgiveable. As a retired editor, could I suggest that publishers return to employing qualified experienced human editors and stop relying on software.",0

"Humdrum metal album Bless everyone who thinks this is from the best heavy metal album of \\""""there\\"""" generation. Such similarity of review suggests young fanboys/girls who haven't a clue what they are talking about. Nevertheless, they are entitled to their opinion, it's just that I disagree. Having absolutely loved every other Avenged Sevenfold albums, this one, I'm afraid, is modern metal by numbers. Check the other reviews that describe the overt influences here. That's hardly earth shattering or ground breaking is it? Sorry folks but the mojo has gone and it will be a hard job to get it back.",0

"Dosn't seem like a real GG DVD I got this product about a week after ordering it.<br />Disc 1 had fallen out of its case and had scratches all over it. It was able to play, but it was kind of blurry and didn't look good.<br />I asked to get a new one which i did.<br />It still feels like there is something wrong with it though. It looks kind of fake. The cover of the CD disc looks like its a copy of a real cover. Disc 3 and 4 were a tiny bit blurry but not enough to bother me. I was kind of disappointed but, it wasn't very expensive so i don't really mind. Though, it was really nice that the company was willing to send me a new disc even though they didn't cause the scratches.",0
Very Enjoyable! Admittedly the book began to suffer from repetition the further it progressed but the fun and excitement remedies this. A great read for the adventurer in anyone!,1
One Star Did not like,0
"Not as good as the hype suggests I bought this book largely based on the excellent reviews it received.      However, while not a bad read it is certainly not great.  I was often bewildered by the author's metaphors: they simply didn't make sense most of the time, and left me wondering if the author sought to create an illusion of superiority by using language that didn't make sense (I'm thinking 'Emperor's New Clothes' here).  I also found it hard to accept and care for the main character, and this for me was the major downfall.    It is well written for the most part and there is some horrific parts and also some humour.  However, I failed to be impressed as others seem to have been.      I am currently half way through 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which is not too dissimilar a book.  I am engrossed by it and this has reinforced my apathy for 'The Book Thief'.",0
mhew present for the other half she rated it,0
"Fun and unexpectedly moving I wasn't expecting much from this book after the mixed reviews but despite of myself I couldn't help falling for the hapless Bridget all over again. I know many fans were appalled by the killing off of Mark Darcy, and I too was wierdly upset when I heard the news, but, for me, the most poignant moments in the book were a result of this plot twist. In many ways the book is candy floss, but this very fact gives the sad moments an unexpected gravitas. Bridget's grief, her love for her children and her determination to live a full life despite her widowhood are portayed with humour and a real fondness for the character by Fielding. It's completely unpretentious and all the more moving for it.<br />My only gripe would be that Bridget's very fortunate financial situation distances from the millions of single parents that might otherwise have related to her more strongly.",1
Hmmmmm Well as much as I love Depeche Mode this album is absolutely awful.  The remixes are almost without exception slow and without soul.  Straight in the bin I am afraid !!,0
"A bit disappointing The first part is a reprise of the BBC Horizon programme and is a useful reminder of what this is all about but the implementation of the diet section is poor with too much emphasis on GI/GL which makes this simple idea overly complicated. The final section gleaned from mumsnet and twitter is just so much padding. There is better and more helpful info on the Internet about this. I love this diet and see it as a way of life that I can work with for the rest of my life. I somehow think that if I'd come to this book knowing nothing about it beforehand I would be baffled. Save your money, surf the net, start the diet!",0
"Flynn creates a river that pulls you along with many turns and meanders. This book is an amazing, psychological that you won't want to put down. Gillian Flynn creates complex characters that you have to read on to delve deeper into to uncover great twists. The story is extremely clever and original so although the events alone may seem far-fetched, the whole story seems believable.<br />The book is almost an insight into the wrongness of the legal system and now someone can defy it. Every bit of this book is perfect from the setting to the wording and the structure.<br />Flynn creates a river that pulls you along with many turns and meanders.<br />READ THIS BOOK!",1

"Lux adds nothing to the eno catalogue I apologise firstly to Eno & anyone who loves boring hospital ward musak that attempts to poorly retread sonic steps already visited many years previously. Yes in the late 70's his then ambient spin was exciting & innovative especially in collaboration with Cluster (creating beautiful, lyrical & exciting experimental landscapes)& albums like 4th Possible Worlds with Jon Hassell & creating what I define as Voodoo ambient music. Even as late as 1992 The Shutov Assembly was an incredibly beautiful and inspiring ambient album that really added to the concept. Even Eno himself says he needs to come up with another definition for ambient that can encompass more. For my money 'Small Craft on a milk sea' is a far more interesting and complex album & possibly more reflects albums like the phenomenally excellent album of Before & after Science (without Eno's vocals unfortunately)which had an ambient side & an upbeat rhythmic side & with a careful bit of editing i.e. removing the 1st 2 ambient tracks & appending them at the end you have 1st an upbeat side & then an ambient side of the album. Like 'Another Green World' unbelievably innovative & with his amazing back catalogue this album hardly moves anywhere & really doesn't affect me emotionally or intellectually. There is really interesting/innovative texturally glorious and exciting ambient music but Lux is not in that category there are another 40 earlier Eno albums that are so far more forward thinking and so much more rewarding.",0

"Utter rubbish I had great expectations for this book as the writer is very accomplished and the subject a favourite. But money was wasted. James knows how to put words together to make nice sentences, but the plot was very lacking. There wasn't enough plot to write a whole book about it and this book reminded me of a bit better written Harlequin. The characters were wothout debth and everything seemed covered with sugar. This will be a very cheap book to by secondhand very soon.",0

"Really wanted to love it I really did want to love this book but unfortunately I think it missed the mark. Not sure R.J. Palacio gave enough credit to her intended age group, it reads painfully simply and 2 dimensional.

Not the strong, endearing character I had hoped for.",0

"Generoquai As time goes by, each one of Jay K's albums sounds successively nearer an \\""""average\\"""" Jamiroquai sound. Each one is progressively less different than and to the last. Using statistics it is possible to establish that, at this rate by 2011 Jak K will be consecutively re-releasing the same album into perpetuity. <br />Far fetched perhaps, but at the outset of Jay K's musical adventure each of his bands' discs occupied a different stylistic corner: Emergency on Planet Earth was chaotic Acid Jazz, Space Cowboy gave a nod to the minimalism of house music, Traveling Without Moving was pure pop, Synchronised attempted a tribute to disco. <br />However, with the ingredients of the Jamiroquai formula already played out in pure form Jay K's only next step was a series of elaborate combination albums that, though ambitious in their intent, formed far less a symbiotic new form and more a virtual, stylistic \\""""best of\\"""". Both A Funk Odyssey and Now Dynamite purely represent delivery against the standards of the Jamiroquai \\""""brand\\"""". Not to labour the point, but the opening tracks of both the last two albums are the same \\""""Feels so good\\"""" / \\""""Feels just like it should\\"""". <br />It's a function of having so much more money and fame than your fans, and thus reduced emotional proximity to your audience, that has led to many an artist being swallowed in the mire of empty concepts and \\""""good will\\"""" songwriting. Elton John, Michael Jackson, Oasis are conspicuous examples. <br />For Generoquai to get back to Jamiroquai Jay K needs to get back to that genre busting approach of the early nineties. Either that or by 2011 the law of averageness will have taken another one of pop music's leading lights.",0

"Films never do the book justice I have just returned from watching One Day after absolutely falling in love with the book and I have to say that although I enjoyed the film, I think that it could have been better.     For me, the characters were played well by both Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess but it annoyed me how chunks of the storyline were missed out just so that each year could be conveniently concluded before we moved on the the next one. I went with a friend who had never read the book but did very much enjoy the film and although I did too, I had a few gripes:    In the book, the reader is told where the characters are on July 15 each year but you don't get that in the film. Instead, you are left guessing - is that France? How come Emma moved to Paris? Which University did they go to? Are they in London now? In the book, the locations play an integral part of the story of their lives, for example, Edinburgh is a very big deal! It is, after all, where Dex and Emma first meet after graduating and it is where Dex and his child return much later. Sadly the film fails spectacularly on this level.     The book also focuses on some very moving moments such as the frankly hideous and painful chapter where Dex meets Silvie's parents and odious brothers. You just know that he is completely out of his depth with this hideously posh and pretentious family but the film doesn't manage to convey this sense of social awkwardness. Also, the part in the book where Dex is babysitting was a very poignant moment because somehow Dex has managed to grow up, get married and become a dad but, again, the film does not convey the emotion surrounding this particular period in Dex's life.     Moving on to another character, in the book, Ian was frankly an annoying pitiful loser but the film didn't bring that over to me. The film made him actually likeable and rather witty. But although this was another of my gripes I must say that the actor who played him did a really good job and his scene with Dex towards the endwas very moving.     I could go on. And on.     I suggest that you watch One Day because it really is quite a decent film. Anne Hathaway's accent is certainly not Northern but it is no Dick Van Dyke either. Jim Sturgess is gorgeous and he carried the film for me. Just don't expect it to be like the book.",0

"Sequel or Prequel? Ridley Scott's own comments might help to clarify ... This is a redrafted review of the film (using the same star rating) after one particular comment-making ranter for my original review couldn't let go of his opinion about whether 'Prometheus' is a prequel or sequel to 'Alien'. After I used a quote from Ridley Scott to clarify the issue, he resorted to infantile insults after presumably having to accept that either or neither of the two camps is right.  Before I explain my own rating for the film, here is a direct lift from a website which quoted Scott's reactions to the question which seems to so divide opinions. Maybe it will help anyone who is absolutely certain that their interpretation is right .....<br /><br />\\"""".... the question of how directly Ridley Scott's new film should be viewed as a prequel to \\""""Alien\\"""" keeps needing to be asked. Scott has been talking circles around the \\""""prequel\\"""" issue for many months and he did so again with a group of reporters gathered for the \\""""Prometheus\\"""" junket at Claridge's in London. \\""""For all intents and purposes this is very loosely a prequel, very,\\"""" Scott maintains ....\\""""<br /><br />So there you are - even Scott isn't 100% sure. If you track down Scott's responses in full, you'll soon see that he seems to have been more attracted to the basic idea of the film rather than in trying to logically extend the story's chronology .... in either direction. Even he isn't totally sure whether the film is a prequel or sequel.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />My own brief review contains spoilers about how the film ends. So be warned.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I found the basic plot-line of  'Prometheus' to be too full of holes and coincidental events to rate it as being particularly good. For instance, after flying across the universe, the crew lands on a planet without any trace or evidence of life. Within minutes, they discover an unnaturally straight line which leads towards a massive and highly visible alien structure. Unfeasible or what, especially as later references suggest that there are many such structure on the planet --- a planet previously described as being barren of any such evidence.<br /><br />The characters are almost all unpleasant or driven by their own selfish aims and the few gross images certainly go for broke. (eg: a slimy snake-like alien entering its human host by ramming itself down the throat). The only real 'hero' is the ship's captain who eventually does 'the honourable thing' and destroys his ship in an attempt to stop an alien invasion of Earth - almost certainly futile, as it turns out when you interpet the final image of the film. The lead character of the andoid David is, by virtue of his existence and 'nature', souless and driven only by the programmed demands and desires of his supposedly dead creator. He is so much like a manifestation of 2001's HAL as to be almost laughable. The fact that the first 5 minutes or so inside the spacecraft also looks like a rebuilt set from 2001 exaggerates this feeling. Maybe that was meant as a tribute to Kubrik's vision? I hope so or else it was an ill-considered design.<br /><br />The ending seems especially lazy with the sole survivor flying off towards the stars with a cliched line about 'going on searching\\"""". In the darkness left behind, what do we see but the classic Alien monster emerging from the goo.

"What a book!! A boy growing up in the slums of Limmerick, Ireland, starving, freezing and surrounded by the people real families are made of. The absent alcoholic father, the push over mother, the sour faced aunt and kindly uncle and not to mention the grandma who would 'rip the kidney's outta ya' if you looked at her sideways. Plus the odd lunatic or two!<br />I rarely read biography/non fiction type books anymore, especially if they are written about that persons childhood, i find it depressing and the images stick in my head forever but this book was given to me by my mother and i was bored so i made an exception. I am glad i did, this book is not like any of the other childhood accounts i have read before. The authour paints a watercolour of bleak, smog filled, rainy streets so vivid that you feel the mist rising off the Shannon and hitting you in your face. He takes you on a journey that is unforgetable and manages to make even the most heartbreaking scene full of humour, making you laugh and cry at the same time and the way he can describe something as simple as a cheese sandwich leaves you drooling so badly you have to stop reading so you can make yourself one!<br />My all time favourite book that i would go back to again and again. Sad, funny, entertaining and honest. A remarkable read that never fails to give you a generous helping of everything a book should have.",1

It follows the anime very nicely, and reveals even more about the story than what came forth in the movie.

"Very easy. If you get stuck on a level just ... Very easy. If you get stuck on a level just click everywhere on the screen until you figure it out. I finished the whole game in less than an hour, and its not like you can play it again as you already know where everything is. Glad I didn't pay for it.",0
Rubbish I think it is bad because you get half way and you need to pay money just to get your speed higher,0
"Meh again Like the others in this series, this is interesting for maybe an hour or two, so good thing it was a free app of the day. Levels quickly become repetitive and with so few of them you'll be done before you know it. Also, it requires you to press all over the screen because some clues are only revealed by very precise touches. Sometimes if you reveal one clue, then another one becomes available if you go back pressing over the areas previously explored. One puzzle really stumped me, why, because it requires you to rotate buttons with various lines and corners drawn on them to form an incredibly offensive symbol - I assumed that it couldn't possibly be the correct way to solve it, until I checked the walkthrough - and it's not like there were any obvious clues, and I mean it would have to be very obvious (if you know what I mean!).",0
I love you Jesus but Harry makes me tingle more Jesus has watched over for 30 years but since I saw Harry and his sweet sweet friends I know I will never be alone again. 1D is better than cakes and even my dad.

Really beautiful novel about follow a dream. I already read it twice in portuguese but now I decided to buy it in english to read again. I really recommend this seller.",1
"Elvis great as usual; Editing appaling tho Elvis was great in the show/documentary. It is a shame that the editing was so ridiculous, with lots of extra material being left out (such as the part where Elvis sits on a stool and plays the guitar on stage), songs like Sweet Caroline, Bridge Over Troubled Water... etc.",0

Five Stars very GOOD !!!!!!,1
"Not as good as Phobia I bought the album last week, and i was really pleased with their latest single \\""""i will not bow\\"""", but the album itself doesnt live up to what i thought the album was going to sound like. The tracks sound all too the same, and its not a rubbish album but not great. Phobia is definitely the better album, i will still listen perhaps this one will grow on me a bit but first impressions, i dont think its as good as b/b can actually do.",0
good..but I like this album but think some of the songs are a bit weak e.g Diesel Power. I did like Fuel my Fire a lot.,0

"A step in the wrong direction Joe Abercrombie is one of my favourite fiction writers. I thoroughly enjoyed the First Law trilorgy and the sequels and was excited to see what else Joe has to offer and the direction he would be taking the series. Sadly, as I pointed out in the title, the step he takes with Red Country just goes... awry.<br /><br />I have no idea what made Joe write a C grade WESTERN. Yes, a WESTERN! The book contains every single western cliche, straight out of bad movies. We have a wild country to explore, indians, everyone wears hats (and spits a lot), everyone seems to be looking for a new life (and gold), I could go on and on and on... After being attacked on the open plains by what clearly appear to be native americans our heroic caravan makes a circle out of wagons, there is also a wagon chase/fight, a hopeless last stand, a supposedly legendary explorer, a high noon showdown and even a good old fashioned ho down. The western motif feels completely forced into the First law universe and as a result the book is less than satisfactory.<br /><br />I wish that was the only problem with Red Country. The pace is needlesly drawn out, with absolutely nothing happening for most of the book. Nothing. After driving a caravan across the barren plains (nothing happens throughout the journey mind you) there is a period where all the people seem to do is sit about the town, drink and ask a few pointless questions while one of them undertakes carpentry. Sounds boring? It is. As are the new characters, which (at lest to me) are unrealistic, uninteresting and most of all unworthy of being protagonists of any book. The book only comes to life in sections concerning old fan favourite characters, but sadly that is not enough even for three stars.<br /><br />It seems to me that Joe took a page from George Martin's book here and produced something stunningly below his capabilities. I'm afraid this will damage the series beyond repair. He advanced the timeline too far ahead simply to indulge his ambition to write a cowboy novel. He had a rich universe with many, many interesting characters, all of which we will likely never see again.<br /><br />I give Red Country 2 stars. Had it not been for the (much too sparse) appearances of Niacomo Cosca, it would have been 1.",0

BEST BOOK EVER!!!! Its a great book with information about ww2 and I never got bored of it :),1
"worth it, or cash-in? Have followed Zeppelin since '75 when as a teenager heard Graffiti for the first time, and it has remained my favourite album of all time since. I welcomed with open arms the 1990 remastered series, and was absolutely thrilled when Pagey gave us THAT DVD! These new packages to me, I'm afraid are one step too far and they stink of cash-in. I've read all sorts of stories of lousy remastering, rubbish bonus material, and the usual batch of lemmings thinking they've discovered the Holy Grail! I'm not bothering. They might be the greatest band of all time, but they've had enough of my money!",1

"A book to study rather than read This is sumptuously written - and I can see why it won the Booker prize, on the strength of the writing alone. But, I've got to be honest, I gave up half way through. Too many characters, and for a book which is heavily plotted - I just wanted it to cut to the chase more often. Also, I'm rather nervous of books which need a cast list - shouldn't it be obvious who the character is from the writing on the page?. But - I'll take it on my next holiday and try again. I think, without the distractions of everyday life, I could devote the hours needed to reading this properly. And, I believe, in those circumstances I would enjoy this a lot more.",0
"So-So The music tracks are very repetitive however we hope it will grow on us with further playings, if not it will go.",0
"Masterpiece I bought this for my daughter and I to watch as she is studying the book for her GCSE English. It was just as I remembered from my own school days, only better.This time around I had actually read the book, cover to cover! The performances by Gregory Peck and the actress playing Scout, indeed all the children and characters are excellent.<br /><br />There is never a substitute for reading the text but this is as good as it can get. Harper Lee herself was pleased with the screenplay, and I think it captures the essential essence of the novel, its key themes and the innocence,yet also the untainted accuracy of Scout's perspective.",1
"Unrealistic! I rented this film, and so glad I did not buy it, ok.... it starts of belivable and you can kinda get what changes are made from the the orphan (this girl who has been taken by a family, good luck!) and then it become unreal as so many crazy story lines come from no where! Its hard to give the story line away as it is so unrealistic but not worth a penny for this film. I found it dull and funny at times which should not happen in a horror film.",0

"Three Stars Great idea, but couldn't stick to it",0
Doesn't quite work League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Vol. 1 was perfect.<br />Vol. 2 was brilliant.<br />Black Dossier was mixed but on the whole absolutely fascinating.<br />1910 was a little disappointing but my hopes were up.<br />1969 was pretty disappointing and my hopes were fading.<br />2009 is simply disappointing.<br /><br />I was hoping that this last volume would solve the problems with the previous parts but it has failed to do so. Being far too concerned with obscure references and selling short characters we have learnt to love.<br /><br />Orlando is an interesting character but when he/she overshadows both the protagonists of the series then you have a serious problem. He/she is just far too arrogant to care about.<br /><br />The book isn't without its moments. Its criticism of Harry Potter is hilarious and the ending is rather touching<br />but book is just too interested in being clever than telling a compelling story.,0
"OK OK but somewhat disappointing, not as good as we'd thought it'd be from the singles - mainly there's one very annoying track that we have to skip!",0

"Its OK, you wont keep it for long There really isn't much to say about this book, its a collection of funny statements that come from the post-modern \\""""bromance\\"""" comedy of How I Met Your Mother. The statements are funny, mainly because you can hear the Barney character saying them (somehow the writers and casting of the series came up with a complete pig who was still charming) and i have introduced the series to many of my friends.<br /><br />If you were expecting something that isn't in the show then you will be disappointed but its a nice collectors item for a fan and also has a niche quality of collecting all the best jokes that Barney makes in to one book that will make you laugh at a glance.<br /><br />Do be warned though that this is not the kind of book that is kept on a shelf for long and will be passed round groups of friends like a hot potato. Upon reading it once though you will find yourself referencing it in an annoying way and the only way to ensure people get your references is to pass it along.",0

"Meh Well i was looking forward to this book after reading a review claiming it was 'what 50 shade of Grey could have been'. Needless to say i was sorely let down. It blatantly copies 50 Shades, the 2 main characters meet and she falls over. Even the 2 male leads have the same initials, Christain Grey and Gideon Class, reversed initials but still. Gideon suffered terrible trauma as a child, as did Christian, Gideon is a rich powerful businessman like Christian. Neither of the female lead characters are secure, both are jealous of the male's attractiveness to other women, both have one other female they feel threatened by.<br />It tries too hard to be 50 Shades and fails abysmally. The characters are shallow and written terribly, the reader feels no empathy or conenction to them unlike in 50 Shades, and we don't feel like we get to know them very well. The sex scenes are somehow explicit without being erotic, 50 Shades was a huge turn on, Bared to you is not in the slightest.<br />If you're going to copy anything you have to do it better than the original, this doesn't even come close to how good of a read 50 Shades of grey is.",0

"No Sharp plot! Camille is sent home to the small town she grew up in on an assignment after 2 young children are found murdered but this is the type of town where everyone knows each others business and Camille's old anxieties start to come back.  This was bought for me from my wish list which I added after reading Gone Girl-which I through was brilliant  I found this book really creepy but maybe not in the way it was intended?! It is a very dark depressing book with a lot of unpleasant characters and situations. The teenage girls seemed to be an exaggerated version of the nasty girls at my old school and the downtrodden people seemed just as over the top.  I don't want to give any spoilers but I thought it was obvious who was the &#34;culprit&#34; from early on in the book,(but this may have had something to do with the tag line I saw on the book! ) and I saw an episode of casualty years ago which related to part of the book so I kind of knew what was coming! I did find myself wanting to read through the last few pages top see if I was right but end seemed rushed as though the writer had depressed herself so much she just wanted the book finished with!",0

"Superb camerawork and acting, but... Right, to put this in context: The movie basically talks about the story of a very privileged individual, who is trying to overcomes his speech impediment with possibly the best professional help available. He then delivers a canned speech, with assistance during what was (and hopefully will always be) the worst war seen by mankind.    It really puts the hardships of the soldiers into context, eh?    As a story then, this has flaws, well not the story it is more about the presentation of the story. Personally though, I would give it 5 stars. Read on:    The camera work in this movie is SPECTACULAR. Imagine really professional (available light) shallow DOF portrait photography and apply the general theme to the movie. I cannot imagine the amount of discipline the actors would have had to follow( Distance from the camera and maintaining attitude w.r.t the lens etc.) while delivering really  powerful performances. The direction is fantastic as well, but the cinematography and acting in this movie are the real stars! Chuck the WW2 context aside for a minute and this is a very, very rich movie experience otherwise.",0

"sounds better than the CD, but could be very hard on your gear on my VU meters this album was pegged almost through the whole thing.  most vinyl sits at -5ish, so that's a significant achievement even getting vinyl that loud.    sound is reasonably good in spite of that, but will cause all but the most expensive gear to freak out and distort.  mine clearly isn't manly enough for the very loudest parts.    the album itself is very nice.  good mix of old and new metallica.  the package is very cool, though cumbersome - flipping between 5 discs is a bit much for an album with 10 songs, and makes it difficult to do anything else while listening to it...  the artwork is very slick - not at all typical metallica.  i was disappointed to see getty images credited in the liner notes though.    all in all it's a cool thing to have, but for listening enjoyment and convenience i recommend the guitar hero mix that's floating around.",0

"Very disappointing end to the story These episodes are always well written and the writer is clearly not afraid to tackle contentious issues as well as highlight day-to-day problems. How the various characters cope with changing times has perhaps been the main theme of the whole series. The greatest disappointment to this particular episode was its ending. It seemed the storyline was going to end on a high note for all the viewers to enjoy and savour with new potential stories for the next series. Then, right at the end, tragedy of the worst sort that left the viewer stunned in disbelief. Rather than setting us up ready for the next series, the ending has actually discouraged us from wanting to view the next episode. There has been quite a bit of tragedy through the various series in the past (and sadness has to be expected in any drama) and it has been very well acted by the cast, but the extreme circumstances of some of the tragedies has seriously dented the story's authenticity and changed the tone of the programme altogether.",0
Two Stars boring,0
"Very overrated - not a recommended read. I found the book &#34;The One Thing&#34; to be very overrated. Gary Keller comes with a lot of claims and statements, but the majority of them are unsupported or with a weak argumentation behind.<br />He uses a lot of time without really saying anything. Once in a while you stumble upon a good point or two, but it kind of drowns in all the other noise.",0

Then again, I find it amazing that Hello, OK! and Big Brother are so popular.<br />Apart from the writing which is excruciatingly bad in places and the characters who are comic book goodies and baddies, the plot is awful too. The great unciovering in the book made me laugh. Jack's bother and the Gods of Counterfeiting could not work out that dollar bills were being used when even though it was obvious that this was must be the case. Jack then spent a couple of hours looking into it and managed to come to tthat conclusion - one that should have been obvious to all protagonists months earlier.<br />I won't read another one of these books but it just seems a real shame that such a seemingly average author could attract  such a huge following.",0

"Colour Tone not good According to what I have read, this film got a full restoration compared to the other original films but was it worth it?  NO  The colour tone of the new film is rubbish, not only are the reds muted which makes it look dull compared to the recap at the start of Search For Spock, but all highlights are now of a blue tinge.     When you see shots of the Enterprise it is highlighted by blue rather than white. Also if you watch the last scene where Spock's torpedo is on the ground on the Genesis Planet, this is now all blue rather than the green like a normal tropical climate.    If you don't have the film I would reccomend the 2 disc version, don't bother with this, you get much better special features on that set and the colour is better, the 2 disc is a more noise heavy picture so if you have noise reduction capabilities on your TV you want to apply it, but the colour is less distracting in the long run.    I would definitely say the rubbish colour on this dvd is more of a distraction than the extra noise on the 2 disc dvd picture.    I hope if they reissue this again which they are bound to at some point they restore the colour to its original look.  Paramount have certainly dropped the ball on this one.",0

"what a brilliant series! The story ark for this season starts ... wow, what a brilliant series!    The story ark for this season starts from the very first episode and let me tell you the reveal in the finale blew my mind.    Glad that amazon have created this new 'amazon time order' feaure so now i can pre order anything out next year and still get it tomorow.    - FINALE SPOILERS -    Love how Missy turned out to be a pregnant slitheen in disguise. I know that gets a lot of hate but i mean it's such a clever twist, moffat at his best i would say.    I was a little confused on how when missy gave birth at the end, why were her babies pink and not green? At first i thought they were being racist until i thought it through.    Dont you guys see?    Danny Pink is OBVIOUSLY the father. cant wait to find out how in the christmas special this year (:    The only flaw in this season for me was the other big plot twist that Clara was actualy a man and also a robot. This ruined the feelings we had for her and Danny but then Danny cheated on her for a Slitheen so I guess everything is balanced now.    The new doctor is pretty lethal. Maybe a bit too much in the episode 'slap that bitch Clara'  But hey its good to see a darker doctor rather than a slapstick funny and clumsy one.    Oh and on the special features I noticed they added 'announcing the 13th doctor' on there!  I'm really pleased they chose a sexy female character for the role this should attract a more male audience.     I really didn't see that coming though, Nick Minaj would be the last person i could see as the doctor but now I can  easily see the season 9 is going to be awesome.    All together... A very good season. Not many problems with it. Capladi and Colemans acting is great! what more could us whovians ask for?    Deep Meth: 8/10  Into The Salmon: 9/10  Robots Of Hong Kong: 8/10  Listen out for da haters: 7/10  Time Rice: 9/10  The SoulTaker: 8.5/10  Slap That Bitch Clara: 9/10  Hobnobs On The Orient Express: 7/10  Flatline In Burger King: 9.5/10  Into The Kebab Shop Of The Night: 8/10  Pink Water: (part 1) 10/10  Birth In Devon: 9/10    Season Average: 8/10",1
Repulsed by it all I came into this movie with a pretty open mind and an eagerness to watch another movie by the great steven soderbergh.  Boy what a massive disappointed it turned out to be.  liberace himself is an absolutely repulsive character and for that reason alone i couldn't feel comfortable watching it past about the half hour mark so who knows what happened and who cares. sickening.,0
"Not sure what it wants to be I'm a huge sci-fi fan and we've tended to be on the back burner for some time with decent new films of this genre.<br />So getting stuck into the film it's certainly not bad by any means, but it's confused and rather than take a clearly defined &#34;real Alien&#34; prequel it merely skirts around the edges unsure if it's a new film or a re-treading pre Alien.<br /><br />There are undeniable nods to Alien, from the actual seemingly abandoned &#34;Alien ship&#34;, right down to the Aliens themselves which are very close to the ones you find in the original Alien film (ie the long dead ones which were wiped out by the well known Aliens)...clearly intended on the Director's part. But it stops short of being the prequel it should have been, and leaves more questions than it does answers.<br /><br />Visuals are excellent as you would expect from a modern sci-fi with the power of up to date computers and talented CGI artists you won't be left wanting here.<br />Cast is overall quite good with Michael Fassbender taking the part of the android &#34;David&#34; and probably the best performance of the film. Charlize Theron stunning as ever, and decent acting but probably not quite the role I would have picked for her. Noomi Rapace, not a well known actress but does quite well with what she has role wise (I would have picked Charlize for her role). Few other cast members really stand out though, but that's not the real issue of the movie.<br /><br />If Avatar was all CGI and not much story (which in my view it was, great visuals but predictable corny story/plot) Prometheus is a bit of a let down in it's conclusion, it doesn't deal with the questions you want, it fails to be the full blown no messing around prequel it should be. The ending clearly leaves things open for sequels which one hopes explains things (can we smell cash cow?). But as a stand alone movie you will probably be a little let down in the overall package.<br /><br />It's great to see Ridley Scott back in the Director's chair, I only wish he'd have had the guts to do a proper prequel rather than too many nods and winks to Alien, but never taking the risk to really push the genre a bit more. The plot is decent enough (but with some padding in places) despite the lack of conclusions (it's at least more interesting than Avatar) Scott is famed for the original (and probably the best) of the Alien series (only Alien and Aliens were worthy IMO), and Bladerunner another cult classic. This doesn't live up to either movie either in tension or story, or dare I say cast (both films had superb casts this one merely decent), despite the stunning visuals it can't match the moody atmosphere of Bladerunner, not build the tension as well as Alien managed.<br /><br />Overall I can't say it's a 2 star movie (clearly it's not awful or bad), but it's not really up to more than an &#34;ok&#34; 3 stars overall. I did quite enjoy the film the first viewing, but felt little incentive to watch it again. I can't hide my disappointment with the ending which explains little and merely leaves the door open to numerous sequels.<br /><br />Had Scott sat down and done a full blown no fluffing around &#34;Alien Prequel&#34; this could have worked very well, esp since there is much to work with material wise, but we want answers and a proper prequel not a half way house! As it is it's not likely to satisfy Alien fans (and I'm one of them), and it's not departed from that title enough to stand on it's own as a (non Alien prequel) Worth a watch no question, but this isn't going to find a place in the sci-fi classic collection.rector's chair, I only wish he'd have had the guts to do a proper prequel rather than too many nods and winks to Alien, but never taking the risk to really push the genre a bit more.

"Don't bother with this poor book adaptation. My god this film is literally the worst book adaptation and even stoops as low as Twilight. Seriously, the book was extremely charming and entertaining, but in this film they took out the charming bits and skipped about half the book. It's so stupid. Sure, the CGI and acting were pretty good, but apart from that they ruined a perfectly good story.",0

"A good game, but.... It crashes, a lot. I'm playing using a Kindle Fore HDX 7&amp;#34;, and in the space of two hours it's crashed twice as many times. Only way to quit it is to hold the power button for 10+ seconds and reset the kindle. Otherwise, whilst it works its brilliant, the battle system is slow, but intuitive, the crew management is very easy and the story isn't actually as bad as mitt could have been. For free, you can't really complain, but it's not something that, knowing it's current faults, I'd buy.",0

"A disappointment This book is a disappointment. I'm really sorry to have spent my time and money on it. I would definitely not recommend it. It's not that the book is boring and not easy to read. On the contrary the 2/3s of it are pleasant and flowing well enough that you can read it in one go.<br /><br />However as you reach the final part of the book you start to not believe in your eyes. First there is a slight inconsistency with the characters. The main heroine in the beginning appears to be strong and opinionated and defies everyone for the love of her life and then becomes this very weak person who constantly frustrates you with her choices and the things she says (or doesn't say). After a point it makes you wonder why the hero is in love with her at all. The mother who throughout the 2/3s of the book appears to be this shallow person who cares about appearances only, turns into a mother who gives the soundest advice of the whole book.<br /><br />However, those are just details and if that was the only problem I'd be more or less ok. The worse thing is that the story itself is disappointing. Not because there's drama in it, life is not full of roses and if the book was, I wouldn't like it much either. It's because there's too much fake drama just for the sake of it. I mean the author is using one in a million coincidences and metaphysical situations just to create plot and to not allow the characters to finally make their choices.<br /><br />The end was not really a surprise, you could see it coming after a while however until the final pages I was waiting for an unpredicted turning point. I could not really believe that he was going where I thought he was.<br /><br />Overall a huge disappointment not worth my time at all.",0
"Just didn't grab my attention! This book had been featured on Loose Women, and recommended to me by friends, so I looked forward to reading it! However, I very nearly gave up on it, I disliked every person in the story, and whilst I realise this is sometimes a sign of good character writing, in this case not one had a redeeming feature...and they just irritated me! The book was far too wordy and could have been half the length it was, I guessed 'who dunnit' about a third of the way in and quite frankly it bored me!",0

I was looking forward to this movie, i loved reading Captain America comics since the 1970s, but i am disappointed  with this film,<br />It starts off well and i love Hugo Weaving, he played the part well, i hated the new Captain America costume, it just did not look right, they changed it too much, take away the shield and he does not look like Captain America, the first half of the film is good, the second half not so good, the action scenes could have been better, Red Skull looked like The Mask, it looked comical, Hugo Weaving looked more menacing before he took off his face mask.<br />A lot of people on Amazon are giving it rave reviews saying its Fantastic, well its just average! it could have been a lot better, it could have been amazing, sadly i was disappointed and at times bored, watchable on a Sunday afternoon, 5 out of 10.",0

"Superb Film, Disappointing DVD For starters, the movie is fantastic! Fantastic performances from the cast, specifically Corden, Blunt and Streep. The film is visually stunning and Sondheim's songs superb.  However, the DVD is highly disappointing. There are no bonus features of any sort on the disc, and for this price I would expect at least something, a short behind the scenes video for example - they have been released online, why no inclusion on the disc?  Not too pleased with that, but otherwise the film is great, I recommend it to musical fan out there.",0
"I can't see the 'Masterpiece' description I'm just starting to get into Marillion and I first bought Misplaced, then this album, then Clutching at Straws recently.  I had no preconceptions about Fish versus Hogarth etc, but I definitely think that I'm leaning on the Fish side of a preference now.  I've listened to this in its entirety three times now, but the vocals seem too laid back for me, sometimes almost inaudible, whereas I really enjoy the dynamics of the Fish vocals, he sings his guts out sometimes, unlike Hogarth.  I will keep on listening to this but it seems to be overhyped by reviewers on here.",0

"Good WWII Story Jackdaws is set during World War II, in the days, just prior to the D-Day landings. An all woman team is trained to attack a telephone exchange, vital for the German war effort, located in a heavily guarded a French chateau.<br /><br />The story is seen, mainly through the eyes of British secret agent, Flick Clairet, and German intelligence officer, Dietrick Franck, who is trying to track her down.<br /><br />The plot is fairly good, and there is no real dull moments. There are a few parts, in the book where the story can be a bit unbelieveable, as mentioned by other reviewers, such as how quickly the women are trained for the mission, but I would not let that put you off. A pretty good read.",0

Tedious and fragmented The idea behind the  book of communicating through the language of flowers was an interesting one but unfortunately the book wasn't. The characters were thinly drawn and uninteresting. Far too much was left to the imagination and I would have liked much more information about Victoria's childhood upbringing. I lost interest about quarter of the way through. I rarely let a book defeat me but only reached the end of this one by skim reading it. I would not read this author again.,0

"Makes David Cameron Sound Like A Geordie Shore Cast Member This is a brilliant book if you are dead into lineage, or colonialism, or just good old-fashioned elitism. I for one though am not, and therefore I found this book just boring. I will say now that I am a great fan of Dawkins' work and believe him to be a fantastic and important writer in some respects, but this autobiographer is easily the worst thing I have known him to write. Whilst it is clear that the writer has had a fascinating life (with his colonial/empire heavy upbringing etc), I found the way he tells the story of his life is filled with the presumption that every reader is as familiar with 'high culture' as he is himself. On top of this there is an ever-present tone of &#34;I was so utterly fantastic as a child that I used to do things like this&#34; followed by &#34;I was so utterly revolutionary in my ways that everybody must have thought this of me&#34;.<br />This book does have some redeeming qualities, but overall it is smug, self-aggrandising and sometimes just excruciatingly boring. To be avoided.",0

"Muse - In real danger of disappearing up their own backsides Despite the regular criticism of Matt Bellamy and Co as &#34;progressive, pompous and pretentious&#34; Muse has always had a secret weapon. The fact is that they never seemed to take themselves to seriously and you sensed a tongue firmly planted firmly in the cheek. If you are standing in a the middle of a field with 80,000 other fellow human beings requiring a collective communal experience and a bloody good time it is bands like Muse who serve a real purpose and necessary soundtrack . At such gatherings you don't want introspective Damien Rice style love songs you want anthems like &#34;Hysteria&#34; that football teams can use as a soundtrack to their run onto the pitch or songs that involve rather big black holes or overwrought Nina Simone covers. The last two Muse albums have determined for some unknown reason that it is Queen not Radiohead that should be the source inspiration for the band and worse than this its not the hard rocking Queen of &#34;Now I'm here&#34; or &#34;Seven seas of rye&#34; but the high pantomime outfit that produced &#34;The show must go on&#34; or &#34;I'm going slightly mad&#34;. Question - do we really need an alternative version of &#34;Another one bites the dust&#34; in &#34;Panic Station&#34;; in the same vein let us not get started on &#34;Survival&#34;, the awful overblown Olympic theme that no one bought. Equally one can only hope that &#34;Big Freeze&#34; does not commence a concerted move into U2 territory.

"Difficult to follow I really struggled with this book. It is hard to identify the characters involved and made difficult to follow as each chapter is from a different period to the last one with no obvious link. Having completed the book i am not really sure what the plot was.<br />Read this if you like books with non-linear timelines, otherwise don't bother each chapter is not interesting enough to not understand the whole at the end.",0
quite BRILLIANT The a amazing game probably one of the best ever made,1
waste of time It does not work on kindle fire! I can see myself but not the other person - it's basically a mirror. I have checked my settings and the other person was fine so I am removing the app and never downloading it again!,0
"Well written! I ordered this book mainly because it's part of a whole series of shopaholic books, and they all had such good reviews.  I didn't expect too much. My expectations became even lower after seeing the enormous font that was used. Which kind of makes it look like a teen book.  When I started reading however, I was pleasantly surprised. The book is written so well, it's very entertaining.  Even though it's not a very deep book, (and I know, Chicklits are never really deep, but this one is quite superficial) the author makes you want to know more and more. I personally can't identify with her as a shopaholic, (not that I don't enjoy shopping, but Rebecca has really made an art out of finding reasons to buy things) but I think the same rules apply to all kinds of addictions. The excuses are absolutely ridiculous, and absolutely hilarious. In most books, when characters do crazy things like hide a pair of pants from a costumer, from the clothes shop where they just started work, would have been mortifying, but the way the book was written, you can't help but laugh.  I finished the book in about a day, I just couldn't put it down.  The end makes it very clear there is going to be more books in this series. If there wouldn't have been more, I would have found the end a bit abrupt.    All in all, I'd like to give the book 3,5 stars, but unfortunatly as that's not possible, I'll make it 3, cause 4 is just a little bit too much..",0
Five Stars Brilliant cd,1
"Stick with MTG 2014 This game tries too hard to focus on the unnecessary features, such as high quality graphics, meaning the game will often lag on some devices simply by opening a menu. However, this is not the main issue, as there have been several occasions where I have been half way through a game and had to pause it. When I come back to the game, all of the progress for that battle has been lost, meaning I have to start again. It is because of this that instead of playing 2015, I play 2014, which in my opinion is the better game.",0
Five Stars excellent rock music,1

"yet another number one in the charts The deluxe edition of this album has a better picture on the cover and has 3 more  tracks than the standard release. All being very worthwhile additions.  Yes, another album chart topper and track 'we found love' is currently top of the singles chart. So, commercially she has still got it right.  But is this as good as 'rated r' and 'loud'? This is still an absolute must for die hard fans, but are tracks as good as 'only girl in the word' and 'what's my name' ? Are they as original and driving as 'rude boy', 'so hard' and 'russian roulette' ?  Many of the tracks will be very popular in clubs and I would assume at least another 4 appearing in the sigles charts. So, this is a very decent album, but maintaining the previous magnificent standards will not be easy.  As with previous albums, one or two collaboration singles have been excluded for whatever reason.",0

"QOTSA's best album yet and a bleak masterpiece After six years of unreleased material, Queens of the Stone Age returned to us with this masterful and trippy album that showed a new change in direction for the band yet again. QOTSA are renowned for pioneering the stoner rock movement which was heavily influenced by psychedelic music, blues rock as well as metal which they developed on their first three albums. After the firing of bassist Nick Oliveri, they delivered a less abrasive and more lush sounding album with their 2005 release Lullabies to Paralyze and then returned with Era Vulgaris, which sounded like a mix between Rated R (their second album) and Lullabies. Era Vulgaris was a solid album by the band though it suffered slightly for having some derivative tracks and many fans were left feeling disappointed and alienated as they waited six years for Queens to re-emerge with their sixth album ...Like Clockwork. ...Like Clockwork is the group's least heavy sounding album to date but is also their most haunting lyrically and instrumentally. It's their best album since Songs for the Deaf and may even be my all time favourite QOTSA record.<br /><br />...Like Clockwork retains the traditional trippy stoner rock sound that Queens had become renowned for as the opening track 'Keep Your Eyes Peeled' recalls some of the slower ominous doom-inspired tracks off of Lullabies to Paralyze like 'Someone in the Wolf'. 'I Sat by the Ocean' has a more upbeat and catchy ring to it juxtaposed with melancholy lyrics and Josh Homme's emotional vocals. 'The Vampyre of Time and Memory' is the softest track on the album with more emphasis on piano melodies than guitars and 'If I Had a Tail' is more distorted with a very raw lo-fi metal sound. 'My God is the Sun' is another heavy track on the album with a very catchy chorus and slick instrumentation.<br /><br />On the second half of the album, 'Kalopsia' is a uniquely composited song that opens up with a quiet piano tune before bursting out with an explosive chorus. 'Fairweather Friends' features very misanthropic lyrics that I can identify with very well and closes off terrifically with Josh singing 'fair' before cutting off and bluntly stating 'I don't give a s**t about them anyhow'. 'Smooth Sailing' returns to the more heavy sound of 'My God is the Sun' and has a cool bluesy vibe to it that sounds like something off of Era Vulgaris. The last two tracks of the album, 'I Appear Missing' and the title track retain a very dark haunting feel to them that were apparently inspired by Josh Homme's near-death experience. 'I Appear Missing' is possibly my favourite track on the whole album. It has a very bluesy riff and an ominous desert rock melody with reflective lyrics and a very gothic guitar solo in the middle. The title track is a really effective closer as it begins with a mournful piano melody before getting louder with a psychedelic guitar riff bridging the song before the refrain.<br /><br />I may be wrong in this assumption but I always felt that ...Like Clockwork was a concept album whilst listening to it and was split in two halves. The first half of the album sort of hints at something dark but also feels more on the catchy side of metal whilst the second half starts off with sheer bluntness before descending into melancholy and bleakness. On the whole, it's definitely the band's darkest and lyrically emotional album through this. The album is also filled with guest musicians with Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears providing additional vocals on 'Keep Your Eyes Peeled', Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys singing some lyrics on 'If I Had a Tail', Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails singing co-lead vocals on 'Kalopsia' and Sir Elton John on piano and backing vocals on 'Fairweather Friends'.<br /><br />Personal favourites from ...Like Clockwork: 'I Sat By the Ocean', 'If I Had a Tail', 'Kalopsia', 'Fairweather Friends', 'I Appear Missing' and '...Like Clockwork'.<br /><br />...Like Clockwork is one of the best rock albums of the past few years and one of my favourite albums even if it's only a year old now. It's Queens' best album to date and a perfect blend of different genres from blues to psychedelia to doom metal. There's not one bad song on the album and it flows perfectly, feeling very caustic yet also lush and spellbinding.d one of my favourite albums even if it's only a year old now.

"Run it's course... I wish the Shop a Holic books had been kept as a nice little trio, as they were all funny and well written. Now, they are just being churned out and do not have that same sparkle. One big thing I'm not sure about is why the books are set in 2005/6? The credit crunch hadn't even started then and internet shopping and iphones weren't that big either, yet they both feature in the story. Maybe it's just so they can keep Becky in her 20's indefintely? Not much happens, Minnie is a brat (how many times can she say \\""""Miiinnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeee\\"""") and Luke is as boring as ever. I did happen to think,if Becky could oranise two weddings in the Shop a Holic ties the Knot book, then surely organising a party for her husband wouldn't be so hard? I still like Suze and Tarquins characters but not so keen on the Jess/Tom plot. There a few faintly entertaining moments but not enough to raise a smile. I will be re-reading the first three shopaholic books and also Can you Keep a Secret and Twenties Girl, but unfortunately not this one.",0

"Easy on the Candy... Originally, before the album came out I had heard only a few songs from it. I still got a good idea of 'Hard Candy' and decided to write a review on it. Now  have heard the whole album I stand by my below review:    Madonna needs to come up with a record far more original than 'Hard Candy'. Why should Madonna copy what is already out there? Especially when this 'Timberland' hip hop can sound TOO raw, and emotionally shallow. No more songs about booties please! The track The Beat Goes On and 4 Mins do not compare with catchy, Original Madonna classics such as Like A Virgin, Dress You Up, Papa Don't Preach, Ray Of Light, even Hung Up which used the ABBA sample. Miles away seems unfinished to me though I may have heard an early version. But where is the real emotion heard on Like A Prayer? If Madonna wants to do a fun, urban record why not something with more soul? That, I would treasure as a fan.     From hearing the whole album, the other problem that it is listenable but it almost seems like a collection of B sides with the odd decent track thrown in. She's Not Me has a groovy 80s beat to it, with a mysterious 80s intro and the lyrics are fairly amusing. However, towards the end it speeds up into a dance track, thereby making it sound like an extended remix. Give It To Me is also decent with a good beat, synths and a good attitude but then its spoilt with the breakdown in the middle and one of her guest vocals making a sneaky appearence. In fact, the ego of Timberland is demostrated on this Madonna album as he doesn't seem content with simply producing it, each person she collabourates with has to make a brief vocal appearence on her song. Very irrtiating since it is supposted to be a solo album. Incredible has a too harsh and tinny beat and is spoilt with Madonna squealing the word incredable at the end with of course a odd brief vocal appearence from Pharrell. It strikes me that Madonna does need to grow up now and do something with more ballads and soul. Music isnot just for dancing.",0
"Great UK sci-fi modern movie... Very really good effort from UK/Welsh made original science fiction film. Could have possibly been better structured, but relaly does have some very good and stunning visual scenes and moments and excellent 80's sci-fi synth electro soundtrack similar to and very influenced by Blade Runner and Terminator films. See it now, very impressive.",1

"Worth a try if you like Sci-Fi The visual photograhpy is just beautiful and has the same erriness in parts as some of the best scenes from 2001:A Space Oddessey.  Alex Garland has also once again created a compelling screenplay that certainly held my attention the whole way through.    However, the lack of character development means that I didn't really care who lived and who died; it seemed as though Danny Boyle and the budget didn't seem to have the time to build interesting characters, (except Searle, who's attraction to the sun has a lot to say about human nature). As a result the film dashes from one flashy sequence to another.    On the other hand, if you want a sci-fi thrill ride, then Sunshine won't dissapoint. The first-half is sublime, it seems to get carried away in the second-half, but it always held my attention.",0

"Usual over-confident book in American-motivator style first off, I just don't like this author. He sounds like a know-it-all who has life all figured out. Obviously he never really fell on his backside. There's some good insight in the book but it's nothing that you won't find elsewhere or even within your own logic, i.e. I already knew well that technology and email complicate life. Wow, big discovery. The next Einstein?<br /><br />It's just one of these books like 'Rich dad, poor dad', i.e. way overrated by people who seem to go 'Eureka' for every stupid thing they read, but reality is, it's just a book with 15 pages of usable insight, the other 305 pages are about the usual personal autobiografy of Mr. Successful, that I don't give a monkey about. I don't care what this or that author did in his lifetime, if I want to read an autobiography, I have much better choice. I want an author who cuts the BS and gets to the meat and tells me something that I can use immediately.<br /><br />Well, there's very few of these!<br /><br />Have you ever noticed that this type of 'author' (like Robbins, etc etc, yawn) just talks about themselves most of the time?<br /><br />Besides, Ferriss claims to have been 4 times champion of the world in kickboxing, by pushing the opponent off the ring and winning by default. What does that mean? That he's a champion? He's just a cheater with no fighting skills that's trying to pass up for a champion just because a stupid rule allows it. For that matter, you can take a golf ball and put it into an hole with one of your hands, or buy a piano music CD instead of being a concert pianist.<br /><br />So, the message is: 'Be a cheat, be a fake'.<br />Get out of town, Ferriss, and leave the ring to real fighters who dedicated their whole life to their art. You are a fake, and you are not their equal. No one ever did anything truly worthwhile in 4 hours a week, that's how to be  good amateur, not a world champion.",0

"Mockingjay Once started you will probably find the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy an impossible read to put down.  Having said this, however, you will probably only truly enjoy Mockingjay if manic depression is your aphrodisiac and you are an aficionado of blood, guts, gore and bloody carnage (of which there is more in Mockingjay than in the first two books combined multiplied by 10). If, God forbid, an unabridged film version of Mockingjay is ever made I don't think I my stomach would stand it.",0
Five Stars great,1
"Boogeyman 2 Bogus For Belief! It's typical of the mass-market that this depressingly bad 'sequel' is better received than the only one to gain a cinema run, which itself suffered from terribly bad CGI work at the creature of the title's final unveling, plus a narratvie slump, but that first film  boasted three charming characters, especially in the tasty pairing of hotties Barry Watson and 'Bones's wonderful Emily Deschanel, though both deserve a far classier vehicle next time. A surprise the original made it into the cinema, considering it was an amazingly dour affair, yet managed to beseech enough jolt-induced camera angles, slamming doors and fake scares to actually disquiet you.  The wretched sequel achieves none of this and the director's commentary betrays everything wrong with it in a classic way that only the desperate first-timer can have, proclaiming the usual tiresome love of old-school slasher movies, most of which, even at their worst would be far better than this dreck. After his cheerful disclosure that the studio wanted to completely ditch the supernatural element and return to the tired by-the-numbers slasher movies that have sadly never left us since 'Scream' unintentionally brought them back in all their non-glory, therefore completely destroying this redundant franchise's brittle idea from the start, he blatantly namechecks all the usual slashers, while happily using every scene from them he can, and the obligatory sex scene marked out for two imminent diers is too dire for words. He's amazingly chipper all the way through the chat; he even seems to think the sceneario unfolding in a mental hopsitalover a high school or house is inspired, another astoudingly arrogant puff of misguided self-worth, or did he conveniently miss 'Session 9', 'Boo', 'Shrooms', 'House Of 9' and many others in the past decade, to say nothing of 'Halloween's' worthless sequel from 1982.  Betancourt's lies continue: he he went for \\""""real\\"""" actors over the \\""""TV type\\""""-an absolute riot considering naff, unwanted d-movies like this don't call for anything else. None of this lot will become stars, even for this stinker, they're insanely annoying, reminding us their truly worth the dirge they're in, and his mentioning of the slasher long producing stars, like the Bacons and the Depps in the 80s is bull-both those movies were worthy of the money they made (well, one was) and those two stars would have made it anyway, even without them. Incidentally I can't think of one star who'd use any slasher since 'Scream' for a career-ripening ascent. He even rips from the failed 2000 slasher 'Valentine' silly ending of a double-twist killer. Laughingly ghosts are refered to by him and the screenwriter, both saying how where they were filming, ghosts were said to be seen, though they didn't see them. You think?! A shame-they might have made a half decent movie then, but isn't it ironic how this should be brought up, given their die-hard slasher non-credentials favour any other horror appraoch. And both him and his screenwriter get no pluses for getting Jigsaw from the 'Saw' franchise to do a Robert Englund as a psychiatrist. Tobin, try an actual horror film next time.  Just when you think it couldn't get it any worse, Betancourt proclaims he hopes his heroine is a suspect, like it's an amazing thought, rather than the dumbest thing said yet,and mentions Depp again in 'Secret Window' and 'Fight Club'-both films which have nothing to do with this tripe, and its utter paucity of ideas, tension, action and originality. It's completely down to false advertising that I suffered this abysmal bile, as the front cover blatantly embelishes a fantastic illustration of a demonic/spiritually evil being, backed up with the fact a so-called franchise isn't expected to bloody switch sub-genre for its second attempt, whether it's passable entertainment or not. Passed out of a toilet describes this as best, though non-discriminatroy slasher fans-mainly pre-schoolers who've never seen a horror movie,mayget a slight thrill from bits of it on one viewing, but anyone with at least a little dignity, whether fans of the unremarkable first offering or not, would be best to send this non-Boogey snot straight into a Kleenex and bin, if they don't want to pass it on for cross-infection, as this particular bug has already re-circulated into far too many airways.",0
"shocking how bad this actually is. if I could give this book 0 stars I would,  it is just absolutely shocking that the people at marvel ever greenlit a book this bad.<br /><br />The story is simple and basic and at times feelz like it was written for children, there are so many instances where the story conveniently omits certain details to make hulk ths winner or explains how he wins in a way that is completely unrealistic and to anyone who is well versed in the marvel comic universe just seems ludicrous.  the main example of thiz is the way in which any of the characters are taken down as easily as if I disaptched them myself.<br /><br />Now, for reasons that escape me john romita jr is well received by some fans, I just don't get it,  his artwork is terrible and doeznt suit the supposed fast paced scenes within the book,  every character has the same look about them,  other than uniform and it is just simple and very blocky,  if you like this then great I just didn't like the art on a single page, cover artist shouldv'e drawn the main story.<br /><br />Greg Pak is clearly a hulk fan boy,  and I think the book suffers because of it, I own in excess of 300 graphic novels and this is by far the absolute worst of them,  i'm ashamed to say that it is part of my collection.",0
"Tepid I know I'm going to get all sorts of people telling me that I'm wrong, even though, of course, musical taste isn't a matter of right and wrong. But, my God, I find this album dull. The tunes are so predictable, the songs so samey, the production so bland.    I love Americana generally, and there's been some great stuff this year. The latest by the Hold Steady, the National, Mary Gauthier, Arcade Fire, Blitzen Trapper, the Drive-By Truckers; Sufjan Stevens' amazing Adz. And Neil Young, trying something so different and, I think, succeeding. Unlike this... Bits of it are so like Fleet Foxes outtakes it's embarrassing.    I saw them supporting Grizzly Bear, and hoped it would help the album come to life. Sadly it didn't happen.

"Not a very good history Having read the authors previous book I was looking forward to a good read and having read that they took ten years to research it I thought it was going to be great.I found that more than being a history book it was a tirade against Mao blaming him for absolutely everything that happened, it got to the point that I could see the next rant coming.

All histories are biased but this is just so one sided I feel it was a waste of time reading it.If you want to read a good book then buy her other book Wild Swans as that is excellent.",0

"Patchy In my younger days when PHM and TDS were doing the rounds i was purely into rock and had no taste for electronica, and never really discovered i actually liked NIN til the last couple of years. By the time i heard With Teeth tho i was much more familiar with the bands other material, and so i was left with the impression that this album wasn't a brand new studio album in its own right but more a collection of outtakes taken from the PHS, TDS and The Fragile sessions, re-recorded/remastered for With Teeth.<br />Reznor's undeniable genius is evident in a few of the tracks; the title track With Teeth and Right Where It Belongs being my particular favorites, alot of the material harkens back to the previous different eras of NIN so strongly i was just left with the feeling that they belonged with those albums but weren't good enough to make it onto them.<br />Whereas the other albums have a common thread, a unity, With Teeth feels like a pretty disjointed affair with a few highlights on an overall mediocre album. Still it's worth buying if only for With Teeth, Sunspots and Right Where It Belongs.",0

"My fav movie! This is my fav movie of all time, i was happy to get it on blu-ray. It worked great in my ps3 and the movie was great as always. I would recommend this film to anyone of all ages as it is a great movie about a 'dumb' man and his life story including his service in the war, his ping pong experiences and of course his bubba gump shrimp company. &#34;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get&#34;",1
"He's just not that into you.. but he might be in a while! So i read this book a couple of years ago, but after reading some of the reviews I felt that I had to come on here and submit my own.    I really enjoyed reading this book, it made a lot of sense in parts, but I do still believe that people may not be ready and that particualr time, and that timing is everything when it comes to realtionships.    I think if you treat this book as your dating bible I think you could miss out on opportunities, if i had taken the advice in the book I wouldn't be with my boyfriend! one of my friends also read the book and if she had followed it she wouldn't be married to her husband with a baby on the way! (maybe we are the exception to the rule.. you know the friend of a friend of a friend..)    This book is really funny and does make a good read, but I wouldn't use it as dating guide!",0
"Five stars for delivery, one for the actual film. Honestly? The worst Miyazaki film. Easily the weirdest one in that it isn't weird at all, it's a bog-standard, aerial dog-fight, westernised film. Undoubtedly it wouldn't be anywhere near as popular were it not slapped with the Ghibli logo.",0

It is the worst book i have read (i have not seen the film - and can only imagine that it is better)<br /><br />The book is like a short story. There is not detail to it, you could describe the whole story in 2 sentences. The characters are boring. the knowledge about concentration camps etc -is weak, it's like no research has been done.<br /><br />I would not read this book again and would be happy to give my copy away.",0

Constant reminder of how hot Thailand is - becomes tiresome. When I read about guys on Venus I ... Interesting premise. Overmuch inner dialog for a multiplicity of potential protagonists.... leaving the reader wondering if in fact any of the characters are in fact the protagonist. Use of Thai language for the purpose of establishing the author knows the culture - is overwhelming to the point of distraction. The use of one character's ghost dialoging continually with his partner is an incredibly tired old cliche and clumsily done. Constant reminder of how hot Thailand is - becomes tiresome. When I read about guys on Venus I don't need to be told every other page that there's no breathable atmosphere. This book really needs a better editor. Still and all - worth reading.,0
"Middle Of The Road Trip Little Miss Sunshine isn't a good movie. there are some nice moments, and a few vaguely likable characters, but the whole thing comes across as a precious and watered down sentimental rip of Royal Tenenbaums and Down and Out in Beverly Hills type thing with a dash of Napoleon Dynamite. the plotting is weak and highly unbelievable, there's a couple huge coincidences/contrivances that are so extremely contrived that they take you right out of the movie and squarely into \\""""yeah right\\"""" territory - the run in at the gas station for example... come on  <br /> <br />the kid who plays the mute teenage son/brother is irritating when he's mute and even worse when he (inevitably) starts speaking again and boy is he hard on the eyes. the Grandpa character is great but he pops his clogs in the first half hour... that's not a spoiler by the way - it's very obvious that an unrepentant heroin user is not gonna last long in a movie this mawkish, predictable and moralistic <br /> <br />speaking of which, the moral of the flick seems to be the hackneyed \\""""it's whats inside that counts\\"""" thing, with a dash of \\""""ooh aren't beauty pagants weird?\\"""" well duh... but Donnie Darko communicated the grotesqueness of having little girls dolled up and parade around like full grown woman in a much more effective and artful way, and given the real horror of what these pagants can do to young girls (hello Jon Benet) the cheesy fakeness of the final scenes ends up feeling like a cop out.  yes there are some good actors in this movie including the girl who plays young Olive, but they can't do much with a cliched script (bad pacing, cringably unrealistic plotting and some truly awful dialogue) nor can they distract from the way the director is blatantly trying to rip the feel of the Wes Anderson movies off and falling way short... all these attempts to ape a real auteur just made me appreciate what he does a lot more <br /> <br />the whole thing feels like some smug hollywood studio exec's idea of what an independent movie should be, and is probably why the thing is being feted and tipped for acadamy awards and other pointless vapid industry nods. sure it's not as bad as Clerks 2, but what is? some nice moments at the beginning, but Little Miss Sunshine is basically a dull predictable movie that sinks under the weight of its contrived zaniness... hugely overrated",0
Great first read I bought this for my 4 year old who wanted to be read a 'proper book' rather than a baby book.  He absolutely loved this and the 3 other Harold books we bought and now cannot wait to be able to read himself and read them again.,0
"Worth reading, not worth buying at full price The book was worth reading, but was nothing at all like his other books. It gave me insight into the author's lifestyle, and honestly it inspired me to start running, but I did not relate to it in the way I have with his other fantastical fiction novels. Take this book for what it is - an autobiography [using the term loosely].",0
Five Stars The book to read to understand the years to come!,1
"Reynolds phones it in I like Alistair Reynolds. Most of his works are required reading for anyone (like me) who's truly into big-concept space opera SF. His style, normally, reminds me a little of Peter F. Hamilton in his less hysterical moments, minus the glaring grammatical and continuity errors contained within that author's 'Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained' duo. No one can deny Reynolds's commitment to the genre or the scope of his imagination.    House of Suns, unfortunately, falls somewhat short of greatness. It's a little lazy, a little flabby, and a little bit too pat. This is the work of a master on autopilot. The characters don't engage; the 'big bad' is nebulous and ultimately disappointing; the story's universe is bland and underdeveloped. The story would have benefited enormously from expansion and consolidation, perhaps being spread over the more traditional SF trilogy format. The Gentians don't have time or space to grow in this single volume. Perhaps we'll hear from them again?    I hope so. So read this book if you want a simple 'no-brainer' experience, or if you want to introduce a noob to 'hard SF'; me, I'll continue to get my kicks from the none-harder realm of Stephen Donaldson's 'Gap Series' - SF doesn't come any more harrowing than that.",0
"Excellent book As all previous novels, this one will take you to a completely new world you didn't know it existed, but within our own. And all that in one breath.",1
"Not impressed I didnt get this book at all. I dont understand what all the fuss is about. Its not a very brillant style of writing. I have read \\""""who moved my cheese\\"""" and was not impressed either.     I don't understand why its a bestseller.",0
"I want my money back Can I have my money back please? One of the things that you have to get right in a quality SF film is the basic science. Space stations do no fly at the same height and in close orbits because they might bump into each other and that can be embarrassing and expensive. You make sure that they are never close to each other  or at the same height and so their relative speeds are high, probably thousands of miles per hour. Guess what? This means that you cannot travel from one to another using a fire extinguisher. The business of keeping hold of the station, being tethered and not getting separated from it at any price when you cannot get back to it and so will burn up and die are not dealt with realistically. All together this was a wonderful example of marketing hype and Hollywood gazing up its own fundament. There are things that you can get away with and things that you cannot in SF and this film was very unconvincing and personally I was just not able to suspend disbelief. I am glad that the Sandra Bullock was saved, George Clooney was noble and the free fall shots were very well done but I found it to be irritating and disappointing.",0

"A Casual Vacancy I would love to be able to say  something positive about \\"""" A Casual Vacancy \\"""" by JK Rowling. Unfortunately  I cannot . Suffice it to say that it is the book which holds my record for the fastest book I have read - ever - just to get it over and done with.<br /><br />The style is abysmal ,pretentiously near to showing off with inappropriate descriptive words . The technique seems close to Henry James in its long and lingering sentences.......where else would brackets last a WHOLE  page ?.......In trying to ascertain the start of the parentheses ,one could almost lose the will to live .<br /><br />And not one of the characters is remotely  endearing - offering only a bleak  picture of society in all its banal excesses. A study of losers would probably be a better title.<br /><br />Any wit or humour would help ,but I have yet to find any . There is not even any redemption in good descriptive skills.<br /><br />All in all ,it feels as if JK has overdone the showing off bit , and the only parts which remotely resonated were the quoted chapter headings . At least they seemed real.<br /><br />In short , JK has become what used to be in her books - verily  a Dementor.<br /><br />Go get a life JK , and stop showing off<br /><br />As the Critics defined her - she is \\"""" a storyteller like no other\\"""" . That need not mean good .",0

"disappointing The content of the book was poor to say the least. The character was poorly portrayed, he came across as more of a simpleton rather then someone with aspergers and so the author came across as slightly condescending. When adopting characters like these you have to know your stuff. As for the writing techniques, original but lacking in interest.. so poor. After putting up with the book to the end I feel reminded of the uninspiring selection of modern literature. If you're looking for good fiction its not to e found here.",0
A gift for Mum I got this book because my Mum is mad on Maeve Binchy and ended up enjoying it as well. My mum is very happy with it and now keeps checking the amazon site when she is here to see if she can find more books,1
Lovely Book But Not The Best This book was a really nice summer type book and I really enjoyed it a lot! But I found that it took me a while to get into the book even though I enjoyed the storyline. I became annoyed with how slow paced the book was and that nothing significant was happening! I even became irritated with the main character Quentin because of how damn obsessed he was with her and never really showed any sort of affection towards his own friends.<br />The book was very nice but not the best,0
"Eric Von Daniken - Eat Your Heart Out If you believe that space aliens founded Mesoamerican civilisation or that all world civilisation stems from the lost city of Atlantis, you'll love this book. The sad thing is this book starts off with an historically factual and interesting story - the voyages of Zheng He under the Ming emperor Zhou Di around the Indian Ocean in the early 15th century. It then moronically extrapolates these voyages to suggest that the Chinese discovered the New World. The first 3 chapters are sort of believable because essentially they are historically based. It's when Zheng He rounds the Cape of Good Hope and starts to cross the Atlantic that it starts to enter la-la land. Like all good conmen, Menzies starts off with the believable and factual and slowly draws us off into fantasy land. The sad thing about all these type of books is that real history is actually more interesting than this clap-trap.",0

"Fellow/Former Nightwish fans be warned! The word 'Masterpiece' is flung around these days by promoters and record companys haphazardly to describe new musical works and is a word I have come to approach with great caution. After seeing this word in so many reviews for Imaginaerum I had high hopes for it but was truly disappointed.  Album opener 'Taikatalvi' is an ok tune but is a very weak album opener. So not a good start.  'Storytime' is again an ok radio friendly tune but lacks any real power and I can't help but feel that I made myself like it just out of loyalty to Nightwish. Plus the lyrics are really stupid.  'I Want My Tears Back' - Cheesey song that wouldn't look out of place in the Eurovision Song Contest.  'Song Of Myself' starts off ok with classic Nightwish orchestration/metal medley but then ends with a long spoken word poem. I despise spoken passages in albums as they always appear to be album fillers. a space where there should be MUSIC instead!! It seems to end, but then keeps going and going and going for a boring almost six minutes. The biggest, most pointless, most upsetting moment(s) on the whole album.  I absolutely love long epic songs and 'The Poet and the Pendulum' and 'Ghost Love Score' are among my favourite Nightwish songs. However I couldn't help but feel cheated by 'Song Of Myself' and its stupid spoken passage.   And the final cherry on the cake of mediocrity...'Imaginaerum', a pointless closing track comprised of segments from the rest of the album...yet another filler!  Anette showed amazing range on Dark Passion Play, an album I loved but on Imaginaerum her vocals are under-used and seem to take a back seat, only to be used when Tuomas wants.  Imaginaerum reeks of self indulgence and self gratification on Tuomas's part and is nowhere near the brilliance he has shown on Dark Passion Play and previous works. Dark Passion Play had amazing variety, with songs you could actually pick out to listen to again. Imaginaerum just blends together into one long disappointing 'song'.Imaginaerum has some moments of brief brilliance on 'Scaretale', 'Rest Calm' and 'Last Ride of the Day' but overall the album is downright weak with one or two tracks/moments that completely ruin it. Experimentation seems to have been the name of the game on this album (jazz on Slow Love Slow) and worked in places. People say that its a soundtrack album and that we shouldn't all be so quick to judge but ultimately Imaginaerum is weak.  First Epica's 'Design Your Universe', then Unsun's 'Clinic For Dolls' and now Nightwish's 'Imaginaerum'. I have now lost faith in Female fronted Symphonic Metal and will definitely stick to more heavier material.",0

Albums are not made like this anymore unfortunately!! From the opening track to the amazing powerful closer every step of the way theres not a rubbish track on it. Please do your ears a favour and buy it!!!",1
The education system is run to support extroverts? Really ???? The argument that the education system is using pedagogy and practise to suit extroverts is interesting as i know that the education systems in most of the world especially in the uk cumulate in students sitting externally based examinations in an exam hall in complete silence on their own after spending many hours storing and retrieving information based on repetitive practise which is primarily done on one's own. These examinations at 16 and 18 define your whole future and are perfectly suited to an introvert.<br />Some of the studies used to justify the authors opinions barely have any association to the points being made and do not offer much scientific evidence to support her case.,0

A Very Entertaing Book! This is a very entertaining book with many funny moments and interesting ones too.<br /><br />I am British and have always lived here so I found it both interesting and entertaing when Bryson describes what Britain is like from an outsiders view point and the way in which we act!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book!,1

"So-so Having enjoyed The Hundred Year Old Who Climbed Out Of a Window and Disappeared, I wanted to read this author's new book.

"Could be better Personally I don't rate it , I think it lacked the fear factor that I was hoping for. It seemed more like a comedy , there was a lack of gore and seemed too unrealistic with zombies running like a frog on steroids. I was praying that this would be good but I'm gutted that the wait wasn't worth it . I think The Walking Dead has the zombies to a tee in what you expect the zombies to be like, shame.",0

"Good read but not pleasant subject matter This is the first King I have read for some time.  It helps this is a collection of novellas, as sometimes his novels tend to drag on somewhat.

This book is absolutely breathtaking, I fell completely in love with the story of Sydney and Ridge. Maybe Someday is certainly one of the most beautiful books i have ever read.

"Pure genius! First of all, I just want to say that I am a massive metalhead and listen almost exclusively to metal. People accusing babymetal of not being metal clearly don't understand the concept of metal. Chances aare it'll be the same people that accuse metalcore of being &#34;not metal&#34;. Babymetal are most definitely metal. They're actually far more diversse than most metal bands. This album contains elements of melodic death metal, speed metal, power metal, thrash metal, melodic metalcore, industrial metal and electronicore.<br /><br />1. BABYMETAL DEATH: An atmospheric choir opening followed by a brutal barrage of down-tuned distorted guitars. The quality of this track is unbelievable. The riffs are equally as heavy as the likes of Amon Amarth and At the Gates, and the growls certainly compete with such melodic death metal bands, with only the occasional line by Su-metal, Yuimetal and Moametal. This is more of a Kami band song. A fantastic melodic/symphonic death metal track, it works as both an album intro and an independent song.<br /><br />2. メギツネ(Megitsune): A powerful Melodic Metalcore track with amazing riffs and an incredible breakdown. One of the best on the album in my opinion. The vocals are also amazing, most unlike the &#34;Kawaii&#34; sound Babymetal are commonly associated with. Suzuka Nakamoto most definitely can sing!<br /><br />3. ギミチョコ！！(Gimme Chocolate !!): This song is exactly what you'd expect if you had only just heard for the first time that there was such a thing as a J-pop/metal fusion. It's a good track, but doesn't really represent Babymetal as a whole, as it is actually very different to many of the other songs. It's catchy enough but should be listened to in context of the album. This commonly seems to be the first of their songs that people hear, and chances are will give the wrong idea of what the band is like. But still, awesome song, with some great headbang-worthy riffs!<br /><br />4. ギミチョコ！！(Iine!): A most unusual electronicore track. The song basically consists of electronica with powerful distorted guitars and an incredibly catchy chorus. The highlight of the song for me, purely because of how unexpected it was, is when it goes from a quiet, electronic, almost rap section into a brutal distorted growled barrage of deathcore-like insanity. Another brilliant song, though this one took a bit longer to grow on me.<br /><br />5.  紅月-アカツキ (Akatsuki): A catchy, powerful track, though in my opinion one of the less memorable ones on the album. Still, it's a great song and the melodies work perfectly. Not to mention another unbelievably catchy chorus!<br /><br />6. ド・キ・ド・キ☆モーニング (Doki Doki ☆ Morning): An upbeat direct fusion of J-pop and metal, with the perfect combo of electronics and brutal guitar riffs. The second Babymetal song I heard. This song defines &#34;Kawaii metal&#34;!<br /><br />7. おねだり大作戦 (Onedari Daisakusen) Probably the only track on the album I was disappointed with. I mean, it's still a good song, but it's just not up to the standards of the rest of the album.<br /><br />8. 4の歌 (Song 4): A track sung entirely by Yui and Moa, collectively known as Black Babymetal. This song is fundamentaly a thrash song, with a couple riffs taken straight out of Master of Puppets, athough it also contains some rather interesting reggae elements too. A thoroughly enjoyable song, but is not for everyone. i personally think it's great, but is rather confusing!<br /><br />9. ウ・キ・ウ・キ★ミッドナイト (Uki Uki ★ Midnight): Brilliant! An amazing blend of power metal and melodic death metal, with some effective synth and electronic parts too. The contrast of the clean to the growls works perfectly. By far one of the best tracks on the album!<br /><br />10. Catch Me If You Can: My all-time favorite Babymetal song, with a sinister, industrial metal-type intro and catchy melodic chorus. Lots of growls, working well with the clean vocals.This song is just awesome!<br /><br />11. 悪夢の輪舞曲 (Rondo of Nightmare): Another of my personal favorites. This one opens with an insanely heavy intro with incredible double bass pedal work and a brutal guitar part, before quieting to an atmospheric, almost gothic metal verse, an atmosphere continued throughout the song. This track is absolute genius, and one of the heavier ones on the album.<br /><br />12. ヘドバンギャー！！(Headbangya!!): Basically what it says in the name: a track made for headbanging! With the powerful thrash riffs, it's impossible not too! It's also got a very nice, if fairly short, guitar solo that compliments the song perfectly. A metal masterpiece!<br /><br />13. イジメ、ダメ、ゼッタイ (Ijime Dame Zettai) A six-minute power metal song, and a great album closer, going from the gentle piano intro into an amazing guitar riff. This song is packed with powerful melodic vocals, epic guitar solos, and pure metal awesomeness! Ends the album perfectly!<br /><br />In conclusion, this album is a metal masterpiece and anyone that says otherwise needs a kick up the ass!<br />Stay heavy!<br />\m/",1

"Interesting but hard going I chose to read this after enjoying the excellent Fabric of the Cosmos by sting theorist Greene, and some interesting critiques of ST by Smolin. Unfortunately I found this book to be something of a disappointment - a lot of the background is covered in Fabric of the Cosmos, but in a far less lucid and engaging manner, and that which is new (such as gauger symmetries and Hilbert spaces) is targeted more at undergraduate and graduate physicists rather than the interested casual reader. I've given this 3 stars, because I am sure that those who really know their subject will get a good deal out of it - but for the interested lay-reader, there are in my opinion much better books out there (Smolin, Greene, Kaku). <br />",0

"Eviscerating yourself would be a more fun experience The only reason this utterly pathetic attempt at a film gets one star is because negative stars cannot be given.  If you are even passingly familiar with the comic book character of Jonah Hex, then do yourself a favour and completely avoid this film so as not to get traumatised by the complete hatchet job they did.    Not only is the character completely wrong, utterly misrepresented and really just completely devoid of any semblance of the original character, but the actual \\""""plot\\"""" \\""""hollywoodisation\\"""" of needing to add weird and impossible \\""""special weapons\\"""" all over and generally the excretable quality of everything in the film makes the viewing experience akin to eating vomit. Someone else's.    As connoiseurs will known Jonah Hex eventually stopped being published and was briefly reincarnated into Hex a comic book that transported our gunfighter to the future in a Car-Wars type of post-apocalypse Earth. This incarnation of Hex lasted only 17 comics before going defunct. Then along came Vertigo and Dark Horse comics and did a really BAD revival of the original character, dumbing him down and making him basically a dumb redneck who could shoot. And now this, a film that makes the vertigo/Dark horse comics seem like shining examples of good character continuation.  I basically think of this film as just one more desacration of the Jonah Hex character, right up there with the embalming of his corpse after he dies for those who know the actual history of the comic book character.  Avoid this film at all costs. If it were up to me, tarring and feathering of the director would be too good for him.",0

"Natasha This game is ok. Nothing fantastic, just ok. It's quite good for a free game so its probably worth getting.",0
"A mixed bag Let's be fair to Jk she had more than her share of work cut out for her in this book:<br /><br />1. Harry's to find all the Hocruxes and destroy them<br />2. Somehow beat THE most Dark wizard of all time without finishing school<br />3. JK has to answer the question whether Snape really is a an evil toad and why he did he have to go and murder old twinkle eyes AKA Dumbledore<br />4. She has to play 'happy couples' ( mostly RON/Hermione *retches*)<br />5. Write Malfoy's fate (and his mother's too)<br />6. Give us more background info on Dumbledore (is he a half-blood?)<br />7. Tell us exactly who is gonna die.<br />8. & in the midst of all that prepare Bill/Fleur's wedding. *PHEW*<br /><br />Like most of the Harry Potter fans I was eagerly awaiting this book. One word. DISAPPOINTING. I know that Jk is not the best writer in the world but I feel she took too much on. Her desire to tie all the loose ends meant an inconsistency in style. I mean there was hardly any character development. Ron & Hermione are sucking each others faces off (forgive the graphic phrase) and the Malfoy family are just sulking around. Voldermot himself never gets to show just how evil he is directly, another indication of a rushed book. The death of some (OK most) of the charcaters doesn't seem to have much impact unless they have been known to us for the last 6 years. As a reader you feel emotional detached from them. Not good. Jk herself is far too busy with writing out an encyclopedia article  on Dumbledore's past for at least a good third of the book which means it gets pretty dull & you start to wish that both Voldermot & Harry both drop dead. However, on the plus side I think she explains Snape beautifully even though his *cough* end was one of the worst stuff I've ever read. The title is extremely misleading after you read the book as there is very little about 'Deathly Hallows' in this book. Plus, I think it shouldn't be called 'Harry potter and T.D.H' but 'the life & mistakes of Dumbledore.' Aside from all that, you feel that history is repeating itself in the form of Lupin and Tonks. War does that of course but you can't help feel for most of the book that Jk is being convenient for herself. She should have realised that some things are best left unexplained. Harry himself does not exactly mature & JK seems adamant to make him the unconventional hero  which means Hermione has to do most of the work of course.<br />  After reading this book I can't help but feel she should have wrote TWO books. Nonetheless, my heart warmed towards Harry as I realised as it meant that he couldn't be with Ginny in case she gets killed. They are meant to be! The little epilogue Jk did after the main action was nice break. But hell did come as a shock! All the sulky teenagers we as readers were used all grown up. Shock, horror!story is repeating itself in the form of Lupin and Tonks. War does that of course but you can't help feel for most of the book that Jk is being convenient for herself.

"Good blockbuster, bad Star Trek Well made, generally good perfomances but a poor script that thinks throwing in easter eggs is knowing trek, when in fact they miss the point of trek entirely most of the time.  Rehashing the end of Wrath of Kahn was cheap and lacked any punch. Not a bad film, but a terrible Star Trek film.",0
"Realistic, Frightening and Short It gave me an insight into what it is like to be up in outer space above the earth. It also had some pretty terrifying scenes like when the space debris destroyed the space shuttle and ISS. I did like the realistic of the film to some extent. Despite the action, the film was shorter than I was expecting. If it had more of a plot, enough to make it 2 hours long, I think I would have rated it a 5. The scene that really lightened the mood was when Dr. Ryan Stone lands safely back on earth.",1

"Unnecessary music It is a great film except for one very important thing... the music. Sometimes it was so loud that the dialogue was obliterated and one had constantly to adjust the volume control. Unfortunately this has become a serious problem with many modern films.

"So what is new? Prog Rock royalty release their 4th studio album and I am sure it will sell well just because of their history and media coverage (eg. last months Prog Rock mag). Transatlantic have been described as a prog rock 'supergroup' consisting of 4 individuals well establish in the genre, each with a substantial music back catalogue with other well known and successful bands. By definition much is expected of these 4 musicians as a group and in the past whilst they have delivered easily listening traditional prog/ classical rock easy on most ears they have never really pushed the boat out to create anything dramatically new. The question is how long can they continue fall back on the same formulae without fans recognising a flaw to this concept and getting tired of hearing very much the same. I purchased the deluxe version with the covers and studio DVD, the later being very informative. I'll cover these in reverse.<br /><br />The Studio DVD is a great insight of how the music is made. Clearly the boys come in armed with ideas but NM seems to be the major player with RS rather hesitant coming forward. MP comes over as the groups main arranger (linking the pieces) but primarily it shows what a great drummer he is when listened to in isolation.<br /><br />The 'covers' CD is of limited value. I don't fully appreciate the difference between a 'cover' and a 'copy', these are all copies which to me make little sense, I could grab the originals. I am sure there is an art to making exact copies but not sure the listener gets that much out of it, the originals are normally better, especially vocally (the only bit that cannot be 100% mimicked). The choice of tracks is bit of a cop out and not very inspiring considering their musical genre, only 'Indiscipline' actually excites but even then MP does not take on the Bruford drumming solo at the start. I would have preferred them cover these songs with their own character as Kevin Gilbert, Jakko Jakszyk, Rewiring Genesis did with old classics but maybe they are now so middle of the road that they can't do that.<br /><br />These new pieces of music could come from any Transatlantic release to be honest, there is nothing to make this stand out from their other music, infact in may be slightly inferior. The title track is apparently an 'epic'. I am not sure what their definition of an 'epic' is but pretty sure it should not be defined as quantity over quality. The 'epic' is made up of 8/9 separate pieces of music cellotaped together, not many of those individual themes would stand out by themselves. 'Into the Blue' again takes time to get going but does have a great laid back bubbling-up instrumental in it. 'Shine' is bubblegum with a video to match.<br /><br />I am not sure what value Transatlantic have to the prog rock scene today, they don't progress, they play it very safe, they re-hash main themes to death and fill out tracks with doodles. This will make money for them and gets them to tour (more money) but these 4 guys are hardly doing anything new, they are so far in their comfort zone that they are dithering on automatic. There are very few highlights here, a lot of middle of the road prog rock noise and nothing we have not heard before. I am sure this will please the hardcore Transatlantic fans out here but for us prog rock fans expecting something special from this talented combination this is a disappointing release. Take a chance next time boys,",0

"Blu-ray: again a problem with act III of Siegfried stereo audio track? I compared the blu-rays I received today to Kultur's DVD issue from last year. There is a tiny improvement in the video resolution that is insignificant, at least on the upconverting Oppo bdp-93. I could hear no difference in the audio, at least not in the stereo track. I have a very revealing high-end stereo setup. There was also no difference in the audio when heard through a Benchmark DAC1 PRE and Sennheiser 600's.<br /><br />The initial Kultur DVD issue had a defect in the stereo track of most of act III of Siegfried, which Kultur later corrected. The Siegfried blu-ray seems to have a different kind of problem in the act III stereo track. The Siegfried blu-ray stereo audio track in acts I and II is significantly lower level than the other operas. In act III the volume goes suddenly up so much that you cannot go on listening with the same volume as in acts II and I; you have to turn the volume down significantly. In other words, acts II and I are too quiet and act III too loud. In addition the act III stereo track sounds different even after correcting levels. There is more reverb, the sound is much more forward and the overall timbre is different and more aggressive and unpleasant than acts II and I. It's clear that the act III stereo track is from a different source than the other two acts and is of a lower quality. When I compared the Siegfried blu-ray stereo audio track with the Siegfried DVD, the replacement DVD Kultur sent me for act III of Siegfried has a stereo track that is the same level as the other two acts, but all three acts on the DVD sound more like the lower quality audio on the act III of the blu-ray, but not quite as strident.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />I wrote Kultur about this issue, and this is the response I got on 11/13/12:<br /><br />Dear Mr. Eitan,<br /><br />We received your e-mail regarding the stereo audio on Act III of the Siegfried disc from the Wagner Blu-ray set.<br /><br />When we released this on standard DVD, there was a problem in the master tape where partially through Act III the audio changed from stereo to mono.<br />It was corrected by using the audio track from Warner's original DVD released years ago.<br /><br />And to avoid the same problem for the Blu-ray, the same audio track was used.  So yes, it was from a different source.<br />The volume level can obviously be changed by the viewer, but as far as the other things you mentioned such as reverb, or being more \\""""forward\\"""", the only way that could be changed is if it were re-mixed somehow.

"because you can I have long looked forward to watching this film, largely i confess to take my vote against censorship. If one is legally allowed to eat faeces (i assume it's legal, unless you have stolen someone elses poo), how can it be possible to make it illegal to view it?<br /><br />Sadly the films artistic reputation didn't really shine through for me. I haven't read Dante or de Sade so maybe i missed some of the greatness. What was left was a group of bank manager types in a house full of youngsters struggling to find direction to their \\""""perversions\\"""". Paedophilia is alluded to, and certainly eroticized in the \\""""stories\\"""", which i believe comes from the de Sade element. Even in the context of the films \\""""old vs young\\"""", \\""""weak vs powerful\\"""" themes, it would be twisted to think of this as art..what is art??? Hmmmn not paedophilia.<br /><br />A strong homosexual flavour may also have stoked the original outrage, but in truth very little of the film is explicit in the visual sense. The ending which is rather graphic (and ultimately pointless) doesn't touch the shocking standards expected today in gruesomeness . Some of the shots are beautifully taken and there is a small but intelligent subtext, it works as a curio, but as a timely social statement i'm afraid i don't think Pasolini achieved it then, let alone now.",0
"BROOKLYN: your journey to 1950s Brooklyn via fiction This book was awarded the 2009 Costa Novel Award, and of course is set in Brooklyn, New York. Clean, clear writing that spurs the reader into turning page after page!<br /><br />Eilis has grown up in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, where opportunities for young women are few and far between. Her sister Rose is the star of the family, with a job, beaus, golfing skills and a smart sense of dress that leaves Eilis in the shade. Yet it is Rose who spots the opportunities for her available in the States and with the help of a visiting Parish Priest from Brooklyn, engineers an opening for Eilis across the Atlantic. And so, with a heavy heart Eilis sets off for the bright lights of a new and unknown future.<br /><br />She soon settles into lodgings with her Irish landlady, Mrs Kehoe, and her household of immigrant women. A colourful cast of characters come home to eat and sleep and mix, each searching out their future. Eilis is soon courted by Tony who introduces her to his family, and he begins to forge plans for their future. You can sense her reticence at being pulled in to a relationship, as she studies for her accountancy exams. An event back home soon brings her back to Ireland, where there is the chance that her life will turn upside down, but it is small town gossip and small town mores that make her realise that her future lies in the broader horizon of New York.<br /><br />It is a poignant and charmingly written book, full of period detailed that I was pleased to discover. And such a great cover and covers are always important to attract the reader!",1
"There should be more books like these! This story is not too long, so you can get through it and re-read it many times in a reasonable amount of time. I loved the voice of the French narrator. Four stars because I'm worried the language may be a little dated. Hoping for more similar books!",1

There was nothing that I could see about any of the characters to like and glad the book was passed on to me and I hadn't wasted money buying it. Maybe I am missing something because so many reviewers seemed to think it marvellous and unputdownable, I felt I earned a medal to stick to reading it as far as I did.

"Too much information With the 'fully loaded edition' you receive alternative 'long' versions of numbers plus extras, on one CD, and then alternative takes/demos and extras on another...but not the original album.<br />A much better idea would have been: CD1. Original Album and extra tracks. CD2. Alternative versions, demos etc. This release highlights how good the original album is. As it is there is a lot of stuff you don't need to listen to again, and some of the 'long' versions sound like the missing/restored bit was lifted from an unrelated recording.",0

"Ouch. Sadly this is not a very good film. The majority of the action scenes are ok when they should be brilliant. The best is the one on the outside of the Shinkansen (the bullet train). The worst when Wolverine faces a small army of ninja (yay! go Wolverine), and runs away from them (WHAT!!!) .. I wish I was joking :( If you check out the trailer you will see a clip of the ninja fight which is not in the movie.<br />It is a great shame. Wolverine in Japan is a setting which should work brilliantly. In the comics Wolverine has spent a lot of time in Japan. He understands the code of honor, the history and speaks the language. Unfortunately the people who created this film have thrown that away. He has no love for the Japanese culture and no respect for their traditions.<br />In short this film is rubbish.",0
Really amazing film and captivating plot Really amazing film and captivating plot. 4 stars is only because I didn't see the point of forcing romantic relationships when this is a film about Charles and Erik's origins.,1
addictive Keeps you thinking :) it is an addictive game. I shall be playing this for months! It does not get boring after a few games (like most do) thanks,1
What A Monumental Waste Of Time Both mine and the actors who created this rubbish. A number of very important scenes were so badly lit I couldn't fathom out what was what or who was where. The acting was poor with little interaction or meaningful relationships between the main characters. I wish I had used subtitles just so that I could understand what Christian Bale was actually saying. I haven't seen any of his work before but I presume he has reasonably clear diction and doesn't mumble as if he has a mouthful of cheese sandwich. All in all a very poor effort. Definitely one to leave on the shelf.,0

"Brilliant film, awful Blu-ray This review is mainly of the Blu-ray, and not the actual film - the film is superb and a must-see, I would rate the film 5 stars. However, the Blu-ray release is a massive disappointment. For some reason the UK release is only 1080i 50, not 1080p. The quality is awful and not worth buying the Blu-ray for at all. Very soft and undetailed picture - save some money and buy the DVD instead, you probably won't notice the difference.",0

"So disappointed! I was really looking forward to seeing this film even though it hadn't received great reviews. I watched it with my Mum,Dad and my 9 year old daughter so a good collection of age groups were covered to rate this film. The truth is, my daughter went to her room to play on her laptop after 15 minutes, my Dad drifted in and out of sleep through the entire film and my mum desperately tried to be nice about it even though she was clearly not enjoying it at all. The first hour is incredibly tedious with very little action at all. Infact when there is a hope of something exciting happening it is very short lived and the film quickly reverts back to being dull again. I dont think I have ever watched a film which stops/starts so many times.The last half hour unfortunately doesn't get any better and to be fair when the movie reaches it's climax you just dont care anymore. The plot of the film is basically a group of young film makers who witness a train crash and on this train is a spider like alien who escapes and causes strange things to happen in a small town where the young film makers live. The government try to cover it up as best as possible but things spiral out of control and eventually the children try to find out what is going on.Not much happens basically and eventually the alien flies home in an ending which didn't come soon enough for me. My family also didn't enjoy this film and agreed you would never watch it again. Deeply disappointing really. Save your money and wait for it to come out on Sky, and then maybe watch it out of curiosity but I can assure you that it is not worth it. I expected more from Steven Spielberg. Avoid!!",0
Five Stars Very good,1
"Great score, but hoping for full versions I love the film and its score, and was hoping to hear full length versions of some of the clips in the movie, so was a little disappointed to hear that the snippets in the movie comprise the entire soundtrack. Still, great cd",0

"Bruce Springsteen - A poor starting point The music is of course five stars but this is the best of Bruce Springsteen at its barest minimum. If this new compilation was a a piece of toast the butter would not spread over one quarter of the surface of the bread. Some will say it is the perfect introduction to the Boss for beginners. Actually it is a pretty poor starting point. There are gaps so wide on this album you could herd wilder beast through them. Thus there is not a single song from his brilliant debut \\""""Greetings from Asbury Park New Jersey\\"""" a derisory \\""""Brilliant disguise\\"""" from Tunnel of Love (no \\""""Tougher than the rest\\"""" or \\""""Valentines Day\\""""), nothing from \\""""Lucky town\\"""" and what about some of the largesse released from the vaults of late. Did anyone think about \\""""Because the night\\"""" from \\""""the Promise\\"""" or reflect that a live song or two might not go amiss. With a song per album approach (the contribution from \\""""The River\\"""" is the solitary \\""""Hungry Heart\\"""". Thus it is a sloppy cash in compilation and if \\""""Collection 1973-2012 Australian Tour Edition 2013\\"""" does come hotfoot across thousands of miles from our Commonwealth cousins in Oz frankly they deserve a lot better. In recent months the Lions have trounced them and the First Test of the Ashes is in the bag. As such it is this reviewers intention to restore some balance to those embarking on the journey to discover the Boss. Ignore this standard fare, save yourself three pounds in doing so and get instead the 30 track strong compilation \\""""The Essential Bruce Springsteen\\"""" for nine pounds. Some may carp that it does not contain any tracks from his most recent \\""""Wrecking Ball\\"""" which he is touring; so further to \\""""Essential\\"""" you may wish to spend 4.99 and get that as well. Thats over 40 tracks for about a quid more than this. You know its makes sense.",0

"The Dark Knight it is not It's fair to say that the second film of this Batman trilogy was by one of the best 'superhero' flicks ever put on the big screen, this sadly, fails to live up to the expectations of its predecessor.<br /><br />I first viewed this in a packed cinema on opening night full of enthusiasm, but came out massively disappointed. I went to see it again 2 weeks later not wanting this to be my signed and sealed opinion of the film, but on a second viewing in the same but empty cinema, oh boy! I just wanted the damn thing to finish so I could get out of there. This film was everything the last film was not: Extraordinarily long complete with a senseless and frankly boring plot, silly action, awful pacing sagging particularly heavily in the middle. Bale's once again piss poor Batman takes nearly an hour to show up and he doesn't do much the little of the film he's in besides being stabbed and having his back broken. Bane as the main villain sounded ridiculous and didn't seem menacing or threatening to me at any point, speaking of points, Catwomen was pretty much a wasted effort as well.<br /><br />This is, in fact not a Batman film but a prequel to a film with Joseph Gordon Levitt as the main character, so in the finale it's up to our imaginations to conjure up how Batman survived a nuclear blast... and everybody else in Gotham for that matter, whilst the climax of his story is self evident.<br /><br />A lackluster film with a few redeeming assets, great performances from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, riveting score from Zimmer as ever, but that's about all the positives you can get from this. Wouldn't bother me if I never saw this film again.",0

"Boring beyond words I was going to try and sum up what this book is like, until I saw another reviewer had done it perfectly for me:<br /><br />\\""""2 beautiful people come together (Oh my, another pun) and the rest of the book is basically about Ana wondering if she should let him hit her with stuff and then letting him hit her with stuff and Mr Grey wondering if he should stop hitting her with stuff but still hitting her with stuff while she whines on about wanting \\""""more\\"""" love and less of the hitting stuff and he whines on about how he doesn't know how to give \\""""more\\"""" cos he has only ever hit people with stuff.\\""""<br /><br />Quite literally, that's it. I lost interest in the book very early on when he flicked her nipple for the first time and she had an earth shattering orgasm. I honestly wouldn't believe the author is a woman considering how totally unrealistic and unerotic the sex scenes are. The endless 'oh my's and references to her \\""""inner goddess\\"""" are infuriating.<br /><br />In short, seriously don't bother",0

"All Build Up and No Release Six Years.     I waited six years for progress and answers and all I got was more cliff hangers.     Because George knows the only way we will wait another 6 years is if he resolves as little as possible.     When I neared the end of the book I had such high hopes. So many threads were converging, it would clearly end in an amazing climax.     But it didn't.     I am sure this book will get some good reviews. It has some pleasant chapters and was enjoyable to read, but that is simply because I and many others have waited so long, that we would be happy with anything new.     But this is no book to re-read.     For every surprise, there is a hundred pages of tedium.     The book meanders about, and feels like George wrote simply for the sake of writing. It was all build up and no release, and that's bloody unacceptable after six years of waiting.     I know there will be fans of the book, those who angrily defend it, and I really wish I was one of them. But instead of sliding this book onto my bookshelf, well satisfied, I simply want to throw it out a window.     I really couldn't be anymore disappointed.",0

Honestly, in-between the pseudo-historical detritus, the unnecessary sub plot and the fact that.....<br /><br />Chapter 3<br />Never have I before read a book and began correcting it, and I know very little about Medieval France, but honestly the supposed facts are more like the ranting of some fool with a delusional conspiracy complex .<br /><br />Chapter 4<br />One feels misguided and misjudged and by saying these things a secret agent of the Catholic Church.  At the risk of sounding contrite: \\""""Yeah Whatever\\"""" This book is what would happen if you took a thousand monkeys, gave them all type writers, an infinite amount of time and then beat them when they produced the complete works of Shakespeare so often that one monkey follows the example of the Marquis de Sade and smears his own excrement all over the page, then throws it at a stupider monkey who has a degree in marketing, who then convinces some idiot to publish it. That would be better than this monstrosity.<br /><br />Chapter 5<br />And the some cretin made a film adaptation?<br /><br />Chapter 6<br />I agree, why no zero score? Surely the clever people at Amazon could give a new rating, along the lines of \\""""consign to the depths of hell\\"""" or merely \\""""As bad as the Da Vinci Code\\""""",0

"A Punishing Read As an avid reader I read lots of books but I do usually vet the books I read before buying them to diminish the possibility of taking home a turkey.  However every now and again I find that I do end up with a turkey and Dragon Tattoo was one of them.<br />Reading the tedious dreary dull over elaborated prose , I formed an impression of the author in my minds eye. If I hadn't have known the author was a man I'd have thought it had been written by a looney left wing feminist lesbian , but that I conjectured was Larsson's alter ego at play. He constantly beats the drum and champions women as victims to such an extent that one is left feeling that almost all the women in the world are abused and most men are vile abusers. I find his laborious graphic scenes of gratuitous violence towards women by nasty men disturbing and all too frequent  in this book.<br />  I have real issues with the unbelievable plot and the credibility of the characters in the story , Salanders character is absurd , there are no limits to what she can do from becoming a billionaire overnight by robbing a baddie by hacking into his computer to thrashing a guy built like a heavyweight boxer with her bare fists.  Quite a feat for a 4 foot 11\\"""" 90lb pigmy. If you're happy reading material far removed from any semblance of reality and crammed with mindnumbingly boring detail irrelevant to the plot than this is the book for you. Personally I find it disturbing so many readers rate this book as a five star thriller , it begs the question of what other books those people read , Dragons Tattoo is about a mediocre read as you can get for too many reasons to mention here.  It's on par with a grubby little tabloid newspaper from a literary analogy. Another critism of the book is the extensive detail the author spends on unnecessary mundane acts such as drinking coffee , I never counted the amount of cups of coffee Blomvist drank over the course of the book but it must have been in the hundreds , the same obsessive detail is also given to smoking cigarettes and Ikea furniture. Larsson is definitely a prime candidate for obsessive compulsion disorder.<br />  However having read about 80 percent of his second book before ripping it up and putting it out of circulation Dragons Tattoo is comparatively good , god only knows how bad the third book is but I don't want to go there. Bad books rob you of valuable time , while you are reading garbage you are missing out on reading quality.  But I have to admit if you genuinely enjoy reading Larsson's books then the book has succeeded in its purpose to entertain. I also found Davinci Code to be mindblowingly mediocre , another overhyped package of utter tripe so maybe my tastes differ from the mainstream.  I'll be avoiding the film like the plague , I feel that watching that would reinforce the misery and boredom of what was a very punishing read. The book had such a bad effect on me that I deleted a book on kindle I had yet to read by another Scandinavian author , Jo Nesbo , fearing more of the same.  Ibsen  aside ,Scandinavia isn't exactly renown for its output of literature and I have far too many good books by real writers in the pipeline to chance losing hours of my life  reading another pot boiler.ive detail is also given to smoking cigarettes and Ikea furniture.

"great but... I bought this 'blind' and overall it's a great read so why only 3 stars?<br /><br />Well, it's because there are 2 books within this novel, both very well-written but one is interesting, exciting and insightful and the other is cliched and (basically)overwrought. It veers from psychological thriller (great) to ,basically, a James Bond-type story with an indestructible hero (or two)<br /><br />So, it's worth getting because large parts of it are 5 star material but one feels short-changed by the (admittedly shorter) very weak passages. It's a very long book, was an editor needed?<br /><br />Still, buy it in paperbook at Amazon's price!",0

"Please DON'T patronize a lousy filmmaker's mediocrity. The creator of this movie, has lacked the capacities to envisage this interesting subject with any depth, intelligence or artistic ability. I have not read the book that spurned this movie, and I now will never do that. It has been ruined for me. I have through this film, been left with a sensation of absolute and total UGLINESS in it's utter personification.<br /><br />Every single thing in this film is both ugly and disappointing.<br /><br />Crass incredulity during this movie is an absolute necessity, as is the patience to watch paint dry with a degree of interest. For young people seeing the main actress expose her cellulite ridden flesh (Blame to wonders of Blu-ray) will ensure a few tickets being sold, but for cinema and movie lovers, this film is a grotesque disaster in filmography.<br /><br />I'm bewildered that this gruesome film was ever produced. Obviously some incredibly tasteless people have money to burn.<br /><br />What you're excepted to buy into.<br /><br />Extraterrestrial aliens, with far superior intellect to our own, are interested in dissolving ugly Scotsmen, in a black/transparent liquid for some undefined purpose. It could be for food or it could be for fertilizer. We are not told why. And as the movie progresses we increasingly don't care why. In order to achieve their aim they disguise their negroid females as Caucasian female humans to into entice said ugly Scotsmen into promise of sex, and entice them into said liquid for the aliens who cares what?.<br /><br />THE MESSAGE.<br /><br />Aliens are bad and humans are ugly beyond measure. This is probably true and I hope it is after watching this horror film.<br /><br />The moral to this stupid tale, has to be by necessity, don't accept a lift from pseudo horny bitch, or you're in for bad things to come. The moral for buyer of this video has to be DO NOT encourage bad film making by patronizing it! This movie, bad in every conceivable way, is so ugly as to be an embarrassment to anyone who owns it or watches it.<br /><br />Download it illegally by all means to be able to watch the workings of a deranged mind and lack of talent and intellect.

"Brilliant film, Badly filmed I brought this film, solely on the promos. I thought it was going to be a great film and it is. Well, I say it is but then again, it isn't.<br />As a film concept, this is a take on a super hero film where most studios are to scared to tread. It is a great concept. It's downside is that it is filmed in the first person and there it falls down. The first 45 minutes are hard work and heavy going. The last half an hour, is relatively brilliant. Would I recommend this, only if you can find it in a cheap bin. If they re-film this as a film, then yes, I would recommend this.",0

"such a shame Love the recent boost in superhero films. Thought iron man 1 was excellent and iron man 2 reasonable. This however really disappointed me.<br />I really wanted to enjoy the story as I know a little bit about the comic book background to it.<br />Basically a man Tony Stark ignored has come back spitting fire and after revenge bringing one of Iron Mans most iconic enemies the Mandarin with him.<br />We are presented with a slightly broken Stark who is still smarting from the events at the end of the avengers and who after publicly threatening the bad guys has to deal with the aftermath (after apparently taking NO precautions).<br />Firstly, we do not see iron man much in this film. In part I could understand this as we get to see more of the man.<br />However apart from some of the action scenes, the film seems to collapse in on itself. The infamous reveal which has upset a lot of fans, personally I thought it was ridiculous and didnt help the film at all. It seemed to be an attempt at humour that failed.<br />The final fight with lots of iron man suits just became a confusing mess with lots of suits flying around and...well..blowing up. Apparently several men can rip apart an iron man suit with their bare hands?!?!<br />That Pepper saves the day just again, didnt seem to help the film at all.<br />A real shame that this was such a disappointment after excellent trailers and with such hope behind it. Even as a massive fan of this type of movie I wont be getting it.<br />I know people on here tend to mark reviews down if they give a negative view but I found it hard to be positive.",0
"Below average Anne Tyler is her main influence and it shows.It is full of sentimentality and retrospection which is repeated again and again.This makes it feel and sound like a slushy American novel in spite of it being set in London and written by a Brit.  The book just meanders without any real meaning until it gets to page 170.Then it wakes up a bit and mystery and discovery takes a hold,but it only grips in the final 30 pages.  Too much recollection,too many tear jerking memories,a slightly confused plot with too many repetitions.Lack of real focus and no tension (except right at end)  Where was the editor.Should this book have been published? Probably not..It is not because it is awful,just that it is very ordinary and many people could write a similar book 4/10",0

Im not giving it one star based on the book its based on the rudeness of it not being delivered to me because they couldn't get into my building.,0

"WORST ENDING TO A BOOK SERIES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This review is going to contain major spoliers so please do not read on if this is a problem for you. I cannot believe the ending to this brilliant series of books. Like many other reviewers on here the ending has totally ruined the series for me. I always wanted Katniss to end up with Gale and for Peeta to meet someone else and have a happy ending aswell but i cant believe that the author killed off Prim and gave Gale such a terrible ending with no closure to his character at all. What i loved about Katniss was how she risked her life to protect her sister, so her sister could live and they just killed her off at the last minute. Katniss was also very unlikable throughout this book and there was no need to kill off other characters like Finnink either. There is nothing at all that i actually like about this book and i can only presume that Suzanne Collins had too many glasses of vodka when she wrote this book. Or maybe there was something she really wanted to watch on tv the day she finished this book as she clearly was not bothered about ending this series on a high.",0

"Hilarious After years of hearing about this classic I finally bought it and read it, its one of those books you want to read again directly you finish it.  I have not laughed out loud at a book since reading Bill Bryson's Walk in the Woods.  Gerald's family are hilarious and so are the animals he gradually acquires. I love the way the family decide to move to a bigger house because Gerald's brother wants to invite some people over for a holiday and the house isn't big enough.  Later on Gerald's mother announces that some annoying relatives want to come over and they all decide to move back into a smaller house so that they won't be able to come !!!!  Gerald also speaks of each of the animals as having an amusing eccentric and funny personality and they all really really do, perhaps it comes from living with his mad family.  The funniest part in my view was Dodo the dog whose hip would suddenly and regularly and randomly pop out of joint without the dog moving or doing anything, and then Dodo the dog would scream in agony and the family would be so traumatised by Dodo's screaming that after massaging the hip joint back into place they would be unable to do anything for the rest of the evening.  Read this, I highly recommend it if you need a bit of laughter in your life.",1
"Is this still Rammstein, or is this a different band? Whoever put this album together, what did you do with the real Rammstein?    The new style of music just doesn't work for me anymore, and the degradation started with Rosenrot, when Till started singing, and their style of music started becoming less in-your-face electronic and more rock.  They've lost the perfect balance between the two that made them famous.    As a result, this is probably the least likable Rammstein CD in my collection yet, and the last Rammstein CD, unless they re-release Kokain and Das Model.  I understand that a band needs to progress and evolve, but those suggest getting better...    Highlights of the CD are Haifisch, Ich Tu Dir Weh and Waidmanns Heil, which doesn't say much.  The highest star score on my iPod is Haifish with a four, the only four-star song and Rammlied with a three.  The other song worth a mention is Donaukinder, which you will only find on the Deluxe Edition, which I also gave four stars.    A lot of hype was created with the release of the single, Pussy, which contains slightly more musical genius than a snail's anthem.  It actually sounds like the whole point behind the song is that sex sells and we don't have anything else to sell, so get 'em sex words shoe-horned into whatever the music is doing.    Musically, its a disaster, because it was more important to 'have a dick-haaa' than to produce a song like Mutter where the lyrics and musical score flows into each other as one.  It is however trumped by a worse song, the title track, Liebe Ist Für Alle Da.    If you're an old Rammstein fan like me, you may have to 'forgive' this CD and remember the early days of Rammstein fondly.  The days when they gave us songs like Sonne, Engel, Tier and Spieluhr...",0

"Not Worth the Price Paid There are a couple of nuggets of advice that might be construed as semi-useful, but most of this is recycled from existing literature on the craft of screenwriting.  It's really just a quick fix piece written with the assumption that its readership has the attention span of an aging goldfish.    You know that friend you have who is so in love with the sound of their own voice that they'll just riff on for ages and ages until you're on the verge of telling them to shut the heck up?  Well, Blake is sort of like the literary equivalent of that.  While it starts off all loud and sassy, it quickly deteriorates into a non-stop barrage of written noise.  Just try counting the exclamation marks if you don't believe me.  They start with the title.    As opposed to truly cogent and coherent form for constructing screenplays (with the exception of an oversimplified rewrite of the structural outlines that can be found in any screenwriting literature from Syd Field's 'Screenplay' onwards), Blake seems to be providing more arbitrary pieces of 'advice' that seem to be matters of personal taste as opposed to truly insightful information about the workings of drama.  Ironically, his most valuable piece of information - the part about shifting between positive and negative values within a dramatic unit - is lifted straight out of Robert McKee's 'Story'.    The final straw in determining the author's mental frame of reference occurs when he begins to lampoon solidly crafted films like Steven Spielberg's 'Minority Report' or Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' whilst simultaneously praising vacuous pop hits like 'Miss. Congeniality' and 'Legally Blond'.  What's more, he goes on to dedicate an entire portion of the book to dissecting 'Miss. Congeniality' as a case study in how to make a worthy film in a section called \\""""$100 million in 15 Beats\\"""".    It suddenly becomes painfully obvious precisely what types of films Snyder seems to be wanting to will into existence.  And they're certainly notthe types of films I'd term 'classics' in any sense of the word.    His only notable screenplay successes are the 'Home Alone' rip-off 'Blank Check' and an expensive script sale to Steven Spielberg of an unmade screenplay called 'Nuclear Family' (it's just another version of 'The Incredibles').    If you're really looking to seriously invest in mastering the form, 'Save the Cat' is little more than a library rental on a weekend when you have absolutely nothing else better to do.  The book is obviously geared towards readers looking for 'quick fix' methods to writing screenplays.  Unfortunately for them, if there is a quick fix out there, this book is not it.",0

Awful Very disappointed with this film. I was surprised as I like and have always highly rated Meryl Streep. As hard as she did act it was a no goer. Terrible script. You could not class it as a comedy or anything else. Tommy Lee Jones is a very good actor but the two just didn't work there was no chemistry they didn't look like a married couple.

"Great series, shame about the BD The series is fantastic, no doubt, truly a landmark in television, however the Bluray production is very poor.<br /><br />The show is excellent, a beautifully shot drama that is right up there with some of the finest shows around. The first season is a little slow, a lot of breakfast scenes, but some of the exchanges between characters make for a particularly entertaining show, it is highly recommended.<br /><br />The producers have gone for a hi-tec menu with moving backgrounds and pop ups and this of course causes issues with a PS3, which has a low RAM to start with (users might not have issues with a strong BD player or PS4), it suffers from ridiculously long loading times, often hanging on the loading screen, and the menu selection is delayed. The quality of the picture is not awful, I don't know what it is with TV producers these days adding grain to the shows, The Walking Dead has the same issue, so the bluray transfer always looks poor, however the picture quality is stronger than that of Netflix or Amazon Instant Video that compresses the video for streaming purposes. Overall I was disappointed with the set, simply because of the poor production of the bluray, rather than the quality of the show. If you're deciding on a bluray looking for higher production quality I would not bother, simply buy the cheaper alternative DVD (as there are no bluray exclusives) or get a Netflix subscription.",0

I do not subscribe to social media so I shall never be knocking on a friend's door for more of whatever it is they want, so basically my whole experience is flawed. I would be quite happy to pay for a game if it didn't ask me for dosh ever few minutes.",0

"Starts out good, becomes terrible at the midway point. You'll roll your eyes and burn the book at the ending. The first half of the book is excellent and provides an immersive perspective into life in Stalin's Soviet Union. The author did much research and while it may feel like borderline political propaganda, the author does a good job of portraying a harsh life where citizens are monitored and punished for the smallest criticisms of the government. If you enjoyed books like 1984 or The Giver, you'll probably enjoy the atmosphere in Child 44.<br /><br />The murder-mystery / thriller plot unfortunately takes a dive at the midway point. A steep, harsh dive into cringe-worthy, farcical territory. The author drops enough clues throughout the book that the reader will figure out the identity of the serial killer before the author confirms it, and then the author hands you the serial killer's identity on a silver platter, and you'll probably roll your eyes because you've already guessed it, so there's absolutely no element of surprise. From there, you'll easily figure out the rest of the plot and each turn of the page only confirms what you've already guessed.<br /><br />After the author reveals the serial killer's identity, the rest of the book follows a cliche, made-for-Hollywood cat-and-mouse hunt, peppered with spy novel tropes such as the main character escaping from a prison train, hiding under army trucks, and jumping over helicopters on dirtbikes. Okay, the last part didn't happen, but it might as well have with all the Hollywood tropes thrown in.<br /><br />The ending is the very definition of anti-climactic, as if the author grew bored of writing his own novel and contrived a way to wrap up the plot as quickly as possible.",0

Moreover, there are several things I really disagree with, but that's just my point.<br /><br />The first chapter is actually very boring. It made me seriously doubt about the level of the book but fortunately I've kept reading and, starting from chapter two, the things go better as he starts describing the different postures.<br /><br />Not that good.

"disregard this book I bought this book under the impression it would have a large focus on the diet, with possibly weekly diet plans ect. This was not this case and very little is mentioned in the way of actual meals, just the odd one thrown in, but these are out weighed by the plugs for the authors other recipe book. It gives a general overview on training methods and pitfalls, but for anyone who has trained for a while, there's nothing new here. Maybe good for an absolute beginner, but far from the best. I would have not bought this book if I'd had the opportunity to see it first.<br />'Power eating' by Susan Kleiner is a far better book. It has more insight into determining proper dietary requirements for each individual reader, suggested diet plans and recipes.",0

Don is an extremely intelligent professor, but is socially inept and most certainly the least socially competent person you could know. The book revolves around Rosie and focuses on Don's battle between logic and instinct when making rational and irrational decisions in his every day life. These decisions are subtle things that any ordinary individual wouldn't take note of to life changing decisions, such as contemplating whether he should engage in sexual intercourse or not. Overall this was a very easy and enjoyable read. I look forward reading the sequel",1

"Between two stools I felt that this book fell between two stools. It could have been an engrossing psychological exploration of a person afflicted with a rare memory disorder, in which case the interiority of the main character would have had to be portrayed much more convincingly. Alternatively, it could have been a thriller, with readers so caught up in the action that they would be willing to suspend disbelief about certain psychological aspects and narrative devices. As it was, it wasn't entirely successful as either.",0

I know that many people like the &#34;pop&#34; tracks in the score, but personally I found them a little twee and all too distracting.

"5 Stars Absolutely adore this book! I struggle to put it down! I also bought one for my best friend's birthday and I know for a fact that she also loves it. One tiny problem is that I bought this book as I am a bit of a perfectionist and when my book arrived, it had a small tear in the top corner of the cover. Was a little bit peeved but then realised that since the aim is to wreck it, it doesn't matter! 5 Stars all day long.",1
"Excellent service by the Book Depository, but really dull book depsite what all people say! I confirm my opinion for other orders at the Book Depository - excellent service! I received the book in less than a week, which was surprising as it was an international delivery UK-Italy, and I definitely recommend it. The only piece of criticism: when placing the order for this item, I also purchased a book by Bill Bryson, but it seemed that I couldn't avoid paying delivery costs twice instead that once, having both books sent in one parcel - but maybe I oversaw some passage myself...<br /><br />Beside that... I personally found E.L. James book's boring, repetitive, full of clichés, and written in a quite dull style... I don't recommend it, and I won't go on reading the other two books either.",0
Flappy Bird? It is practically the same as floppy bird for those of us who missed out. Highly addictive and great fun! Kept me quite for hours on end! Great and highly recommend!!!!,1

"patchy and inconsistent I have really tried to like this album. Most Rush fans have raved about how this is a return to form etc, back to the glory days...    Well, I've now listened to it lots of times and I'm still not won over.    The first problem for me is this comparison with other recent albums. Sorry to disagree but Vapor Trails is superb in my book - one of their best ever. Test for Echo is not nearly as bad as people claim, Roll the Bones excellent.    So back to Snakes and Arrows.    Let's start with the good news - the production is fantastic, probably the best ever done. There are no really terrible tracks on this album - like you do occasionally get on some of their recent stuff.    But then there's the bad news - there are very few stand-out tracks. A lot of them seem to drift one into the other without noticing it. What I like about Rush and their main strength is the ability to write songs that really capture your imagination, inspire you and keep wanting to play over and over again - for example, Time Stand Still, Bravado, Peaceable Kingdom, Out of the Cradle or to go further back - Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, Fly by Night, Closer to the Heart, The Trees etc etc etc    I just don't get that feeling with many of the tracks here.    Let's start with the music itself. I don't know why the producer got it into his head that Rush should try to recapture their glory days by reverting to that style. Don't get me wrong - I love 70s, early 80s Rush -some of their best stuff was done then. But there seems to be this view around that they stopped doing anything good after the mid 80s and that this era had to be imitated in some way.     Well, I strongly disagree, In particular with Vapor Trails, I felt they had really hit the nail on the head. I took a while to get into VT but now I love it. A dark brooding style can be sensed throughout and the lyrics are fantastic - deeply personal to Neil Peart and very cleverly and imaginatively written.    Now compare that with this.    Far Cry - one of the better tracks, listenable but ponderously and unneccessary repetitive at the beginning and end almost ruining it. When I first heard it, I thought the CD was going wrong!!    Armor and Sword - quite good, this does grow on you. The lyrics and song go well together, although it could be slightly shorter IMO    Workin Them Angels - for me, this is where start to get it wrong. A sort of unoriginal, repetitive version of Circumstances. How many times do we have to hear the words \\""""working them angels\\"""" - this is not like Rush - titles of songs endlessly repeated throughout. It should be possible to capture the meaning of the song without being so obvious    Larger Bowl - too clever by half. A pantoum is a malay poem where some of the lines gets repeated - but for me, the subtlety is lost. It just sounds repetitive!!! The same lyric repeated in slightly different ways is really ridiculous and not at all like the sort of imaginative lyrics we are used to hearing about.     Spindrift - an opportunity lost. I heard a preview of this song before I got the CD and thought \\""""wow\\"""" - dark and hard-hitting. But then when i heard the song I was very disappointed. Again, the repetition doesn't work - just sounds silly - the sun goes down on the western shore, the wind blows hard from the east et al. And the chorus - the wind carry me closer etc - is weak and insipid. There is far too little of Alex Lifeson's dark, brooding guitar and far too much samey acoustic. Interestingly, the live version was much better - the sound was heavier, darker and much more hard-hitting    The Main Monkey Business - sorry guys. I know everyone likes this track but I just don't think it's that special. This isn't bad just not that good. You don't have to go back to la Villa Strangiata or YYZ to hear a good instrumental, hear Limbo again off Test for Echo - that is at least as good if not better than this. I feel there really isn't anything new here - we heard this from Rush years ago - do wewant it repeated? I would rather we hear something that sounds unique. But I guess for the fans of their older stuff who don't like anything post 83/84, then you may be happy with a carbon copy of what's been done before. For me, this isn't good enough.    The Way the Wind Blows - at last, a better track! This is more like it. The lyrics are a bit obvious - slightly more imagination with them would have made this even better - but still hard-hitting. And the music is much better - imaginative and complex but still inspiring. This is what we expect from Rush    Hope - - this is a nice short instrumental. A clever idea as it's not somehting they'd done before - works well    Faithless - superb. By far the best track on the album. The lyrics are intensely moving and evocative - \\""""like a forest bows to winter beneath the deep white silence2 - wow. And really capture the meaning of the song. The strings work very well with the song    Bravest Face - I like this song. It has grown one me massively. A little bit repetitive at times but unusual, thought-provoking, moving from optimism to pessimism very well. Again, this is more like it    Good News First - this isn't bad. One of the most unusual tracks they've written - almost experimental at times. This is more what I'd hoped the album would be like - stretching the musical boundaries much further.    Malignant Narcissm - I like this. It's short but conveys the right dark atmosphere very well - certainly much better than The Main Monkey Business    We Hold On - I am a bit disappointed in this. The tune and music is superb - very catchy. But the lyrics!! Oh dear - really poor. Obvious and cringe-making. Some of the worst Peart's written IMO \\""""How many times must we grate against the repetition\\"""" - silly and too obvious. And even the literary allusions are poor -  Measured out in coffee breaks\\"""" - TS Elliott would not be impressed. This needed much greater subtlety and thought - could have been good but the lyrics are just fartoo weak    So to sum up - this is not a bad album - there have been worse. Counterparts springs to mind. But it is for me one of the weakest. I certainly am amazed that so many people like it - and was a bit irrated that Rush decided to plug it so much on their latest tour. Ok for those who love it but I would have preferred they'd dropped the likes of Larger Bowl and Workin Them Angels.    I think people have got too carried away with the \\""""oldness\\"""" of the album -they have tried to hard to recapture an old sound and I feel ruined some of the tracks - rather like putting a square peg in a round hole.     Rush sound good because they have adapted and changed. Fly By Night and Farewell to Kings, Grace Under Pressure were great for their time but could sound dated if remade from scratch now. Their time has come and gone.     And that's the trouble here - they sound like a band desperately trying to recreate a sound from the past and not thinking of adapting their style to the future.    I still love this band - they are by far the best band in the world and certainly massively underrated during their career.    However, this is I feel a step backwards. Hopefully, the next offering will be moving forwards.",0
"Poppier than sail I bought this because I loved how haunting and different to anything else \\""""Sail\\"""" is. It is the stand out best track on the album by a huge margin. The rest of it sounds a bit like a slightly electronic Maroon 5 if they were trying their very best to be zany.",0

"Well worth listening to There are some inspired duets here. Barbra sounds great as always, but much the same in all the songs. As for her 'partners', Blake Shelton was a pleasant surprise for me and I liked Lionel Richie very much too. The duet with Elvis was a bit of a disappointment. But soaring high above all the rest and without compare is Andrea Bocelli. None of the others can beat him, what a voice! Over all I think it is a great album and well worth listening too.",1
"Typical 'Hollywood' approach to a good sci-fi story The acting is fine, the cast is fine, the direction is fine...it's all fine. It follows the book well enough up to a point, but in my opinion what makes this a waste of 90 minutes of your time is that the whole movie is about taking you to the final battle scene, which is pretty much where the movie ends. But the book is much more about what happens after the battle and the way Ender comes to terms with what he has done, which is really the point of the story. For me, too much focus on the CGI and not enough on the actual storyline.",0

"Rushed & disappointing I have been a fan of the books long before the TV series, and along with other readers have also felt the last couple of books weren't living up to expectation. I was hopeful though, that as the last book, it would end with a bang - a gritty, gripping page turner but sadly have been let down.<br /><br />The plot felt rushed & erratic. It seemed watery at best & took second stage to the characters - allowing some that have been long gone (with story lines at the time that wrapped up their own parts in the series) to return with cameo appearences. It was clear that the book was heading in a certain direction from the start. While many would be happy at the return of many of the faces, it felt like a poor ending to a mediocre TV series with cameo's of famous characters rather than a compelling emotion ridden book.<br /><br />Characters that we have been led to love have been left out almost entirely for reasons that do seem to not fit in with their previous nature.<br /><br />Harris has stated that she has known the ending since almost the beginning, but if true then the series has been planned poorly. We readers have been swept up in the romance of Sookie/Eric & even her pasts relationships (Quinn/Bill/Alcide) would have held more credibility than the one that have been given. It does unfortunately seem that Harris has become very bored of the Sookie series & rather than be inventive with her plot & ending. She has not stood true to the characters that she has written & created, nor has she moved with the direction her series had taken, and when the ending which she anticipated so long ago no longer fit - she forced it upon us anyway.",0

It covers both the SL and HL sections well and I enjoy the little bits of advice and examiner tips added on the side of the pages.

And I have found it devilishly hard to get involved with this novel, and am assurred to find others of this mind here. From the start it feels as if there is a gauze upon the narrative, masking the characters, sometimes indistinguishable, with a language which aspires to the luxuriant but falls some way short of everything that Updike could do.     As another reviewer here has said, it appears throughout more a case of tell rather than show.",0

"The first half of the book annoyed me, I would much prefer the girl to ... SO this is a hard book to review for me, I have mixed views-<br /><br />The story is written by death about a little girl who lives in Germany during WW2. The first half of the book annoyed me, I would much prefer the girl to tell the story from her eyes, rather than death. The pointless narratives from death... well they were pointless! Then the writer decides to through in some German words for the fun of it, Why? What is the purpose of that? And the spoilers that you get throughout the book about what's going to happen next really riled me up.<br /><br />The second half of the book I realised the spoilers weren't that bad as they didn't give too much detail away, the German words here and there were easily ignore and the way it was written by death made sense in the end.<br /><br />So all in all in one sentence the story was good I liked it. I wouldn't read it again but the book was just fine, And in the end it all makes sense.",0

"Not Bad - But Not His Best This is OK. But there are too many bulerias and tangos here for my liking. It cannot be described as a complete album like Sirocco. That one really is a killer! There are plenty of collaborations here - perhaps a few too many vocalists. However, this is still a Paco De Lucía album, and there's plenty to praise here. The melody, the phrasing is all there. Rip roaring bulerías, a playful and wistful tango and dreamy liquid like rumbas. He caps it off with an inspired collaboration with Tomatito and Camaron (RIP) which just blew my mind. In short very good - but incredibly, way short of his best. Check out Sirocco, One Summer Night, Live In America, Almoraima, Fuente Y Caudal, and maybe, perhaps Luzía for his definitive works.",0
"The Dragon This is both about the novel and TV-series.<br /><br />We experience old men and women, young girls and boys, and everything in-between in a brutal world where everyone can be a victim. There is sex, nudity, open homosexuality, boys sucking mother’s nipples, girls killing, girls being beaten and crying until they’re red in the face, decapitations, really scary walking dead, dragon babies suckling at a woman’s breasts and so on. This is a great far cry from «family friendly» stories.<br /><br />This is daring and truly mature storytelling.<br /><br />There is a sense of menace right from the start, a mature mood usually not present in many rather childish fantasy novels. We know something bad will happen and that it will rock our world and challenge our perceptions. Characters perceived as main characters may not remain so very long and not be long for the world. Bad people may survive and thrive, and good people may not.<br /><br />I wasn’t initially very excited about the story, since I’m not very interested in what’s going on at royal courts and such, but the story is so well crafted and so engaging that I tend to forget my original misgivings.<br /><br />It’s also well translated from novel to film. The few changes are mostly due to insufficient production funds. Large battle scenes, for instance are mostly left out. We only see the result, not what happened. A clear disadvantage to be sure, but not enough to put me off watching the series.<br /><br />It has a very realistic or at least believable feel to it and I am hooked.<br /><br />The ending, the revelation of the Dragon is clearly one of the greatest ever.",0
"could be better I saw this game and I watched the video. It seemed great. So when I opened it and started a new game, it looked ok... but it can be better. The gameplay is awesome but the music,  visuals, and choice can be improved. The music is nice, but it's not really getting my attention. Visuals is ok but if there was a bit more animation and movement could be better. The choice of disease type could be a more varied, since the normal diseases have the same gene pools and don't have much difference.<br /><br />I'm also thinking of another special disease type. Condition. It is part of the brain and It has control over the neural pathways I.e. impaired vision, love, violence, hallucinations ect. And the only it can travel is by family's so you can send &quot;real&quot; diagnosed families to different countries.

"Waste of money This is a pretty banal film and one that despite several attempts, I have not managed to make past the first 45 mins.<br /><br />I bought this on recommendation from a friend who knew I was into a lot of Nordic Noir.  But this was substantiated by several reviews labelling it as a kind of spoof Norwegian &#34;Blair Witch Project&#34; film.<br /><br />It chronicles the quest of a group of young Norwegians to get behind reports of mysterious goings on in the very north of their country - and whether there is any turth in the myth about Trolls.  There is no acting, sparse plot to base any on and no humour: there is certainly no irony or satire.  I kept waiting, giving it the benefit of the doubt, but after 20 minutes (first time) and 45 minutes (second time), I gave up.<br /><br />There a a huge number of Nordic films, dramas and comedies to get into, but this is a complete waste of money.<br /><br />If anyone knows what happens in the end, let me know.  But to be honest, I am not that bothered.",0

"... this supposed homage to Agatha Christie was so startlingly bad that I felt compelled I very rarely write book reviews but I thought that this supposed homage to Agatha Christie was so startlingly bad that I felt compelled, like many others on here, to say something; if only to prevent other unwary people from buying the book and unjustly rewarding the author. Let me start by saying that I am not at all an unquestioning Christie fan-I find her novels often too full of co-incidence, cliches, and attitiudes that even at the time of writing had become somewhat dated. However she largely created-and certainly perfected-a genre of crisp, clever murder mysteries and within those confines wrote many highy readable,and occasionally brilliant, stories.<br />Now to &#34;The Monogram Murders&#34;. It reads as though it is a deliberate undermining of her novels, by a clever postmodern writer wanting to show the world how amateurish and unliterary she thinks Christie actually was. Essentially it takes all those drawbacks in the original Poirot novels I mentioned above-unlikely plot developments, underdeveloped characterisation, cliches etc-and magnifies them a hundred times. But then we are told by the author that this is sanctioned by the Christie estate and is actually meant to be a genuine appreciation of both Agatha Christie as a writer and Poirot as a character. As such, it shows such a complete failure to understand the original that I find it hard to believe the author is a longstanding professional writer.<br />It is supposedly set in the 1920s. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is absolutely no sense of time whatsoever. Apart from the lack of modern technology, the London scenes could be any time up to and including the present, while Hannah's idea of the psychology of an English village reads more like Massachussets in the 1690s than Devon in the early twentieth century. Most of the dialogue is modern and jarring and the occasional cod French expressions used by Poirot don't ring nearly as true as they do in the originals.<br />Christie's Poirot is unrecognisable in the obnoxious personality portrayed here. The original, beneath all the vanity, was kind-hearted and very conscious of the fact he had originally come to England as a refugee. But he was above all defined by his personality traits, which became so powerful that Christie eventually half-humorously claimed he controlled her rather than the other way around. He craved order and comfort-why would be abandon his luxury flat to live in a boarding house? The original Poirot, if he had wanted to disappear for a while, would have decamped to a grand hotel in Egypt or the Riviera. And never in a million years would he dirty his finger by drawing in mud.<br />I won't spend too much time on the Catchpool character as others have already described his lack of anything in the least bit credible. Why a man whose only announced personality trait is a morbid fear of corpses would willlingly take a job as a homicide investigator escapes me. But more to the point is Hannah's totally extraordinary idea of what the London police force was like in the 1920s. Three murders in a top London hotel are apparently investigated by a single dimwit Scotland Yard detective who is never in the office and one police constable: there is never any sense of anything &#34;official&#34; at all. And no 1920s policeman would ever have called his senior officer his &#34;boss&#34;. Other solecisms abound: referring constantly to &#34;Cambridge University's St Saviour's College&#34; is illiterate. And above all, if you are going to imitate a style and mood be master of your material-Hannah cannot tell the difference between &#34;Lady Wallace&#34; and &#34;Lady Louisa Wallace&#34;, a mistake Christie would never have made.<br />And on to the denouement...it was ridiculous. So absurdly complicated and unlikely that it made even the most extreme of Christie's plots seem plausible. None of the conspiracies and counter-conspiracies was in the least convincing, nor really was the method by which Poirot arrived at the truth. The final murder-in front of 100 people-was almost comical in its pointlessness and peculiar in the general lack of concern it generated. As others have written, part of Christie's great ability was her economy of scale-crisp language, tight plotting, short novels.This is far too long and unwieldy.<br />So all in all, a dreadful book.ich Poirot arrived at the truth.

"Amazingly accomplished debut. In terms of the 'greatest debut album of all-time' accolade that is frequently talked about, this has to be in the running. It was just one of those moments in the history of rock where everything clicked. Superb songs like Walk in my Shadow, the Hunter, played with passion and power, mixed with more plaintive soulful material to complete an album which considering their age ( they were all 17 ish) is still amazing. Kossof's solo in Goin' Down Slow still blows me away after all these years.",1
"Err....let's leave the composing to Bach This just isn't the WTC that I know and love and worship and play every day. I won't disagree for a minute that the pieces are played with great attention to detail, every suspension and theme entry is picked out with clarity. And tempo-wise, I agree with the pace of nearly every pair. What I disagree with is the interpretation of some of the pieces here. <br />The nature of the WTC (no expression marks except in the B minor pair) means that every person is going to play each prelude and fugue in a different way, and I absolutely accept that - but some of Gulda's playing goes too far for me. Take for example the C sharp minor fugue with its mysterious chromaticism. In my opinion this fugue starts pianissimo, builds in the middle, and ebbs away at the end. Instead, Gulda plays it a resounding fortissimo all the way through, destroying any subtlety. <br />Another aspect of this recording I dislike is the recording quality - listening to this disc sounds like an upright piano and microphone have been placed in a very tiny cork lined room. There is no resonance whatsoever, the sound is beyond dry.  I'm not asking for echoing caves, but I'm not sure what happened to the acoustics here. <br />And my final gripe, which the title refers to, are the improvised inverted mordents which pepper this recording.  I'm confident these aren't written by Bach (I have an urtext edition, and they aren't in there) so why Gulda thinks he has the right to add some in I don't know.  Perhaps there is some convention among Baroque pianists about this, I'm no musicologist so I wouldn't know, but personally it drives me round the bend - especially when serene pieces like the C major prelude are ruined by a little inverted mordent on the last note. <br />So basically, if you don't want a recording of this timelessly immortal and perfect work that sounds like it's been recorded in someone's airing cupboard on an ancient upright piano commandeered by someone with an unhealthy obsession with trillyornaments - stay away.<br />(Though, having said that, I have to hand it to him with the C sharp major pair - spot on!  Wonderful playing.)",0

But I found the narrator and the other characters so utterly uncongenial/uninteresting that I finally admitted to myself (I hate quitting a book unfinished.) that I didn't gave a da-n what they said or did.  Plus the foundational gimmick of Rachel's drinking to blackout leaves me cold as in, &#34;Get thee to a detox and write a book after a year's sobriety.&#34;  As something of an Anglophile, I found the incidental depiction of British life vaguely interesting, though hardly Masterpiece Theater, and not enough to keep me going.",0

She can really carry the character and I wish someone had invested in a script instead of repeat cycle shootouts that were pretty much console game kill em - all.

"Almost four stars!  CHANGED TO FIVE! Almost gave this album four stars, a 1995 release before , for example, Play. I had mixed feelings about the album, and it made it hard to review-but i am humbled by Moby's talent- so I'll givre it my best. The opening track is called Hymn - instrumental- and I like this, track two is one of the better tracks also with female vocals; which I think work well with a lot of Moby's music. Not keen at all on track 3, male vocals hard to say if singing, or screaming- track 4 is only 38 seconds long! I thought it was the end of the track before. Track 5, not a bad tune with the vocals, but sounds dated, as does the next track - and a very energetic one too. I feel bad but I really do not like track 7, 'What Love' - but stick with this album- from now on it significantly improves, for me- and worthy of a 4 star rating at least.. Track 8 First Cool Hive- i do like this a good strong song(reminded me a bit of 'Play') , and the following two songs also good too. Track 11 is a little forgetfult- then we hear track 12 BRILLIANT!  and beautiful, and i also really like the final track- the last two songs are  more timeless and quite different to e.g track 5. Overall, i have to hand it to Moby however-musically, he is a genius. I would recommend this album-I'm glad i have it.   *I HAD TO EDIT MY ORIGINAL REVIEW... THIS HAS BECOME A STRONG CONTENDER FOR MY FAVOURITE MOBY STUDIO ALBUM! I HAVE LISTENED TO IT SO MUCH, AND IT DESERVES 5/5! MY FAVOURITE TRACKS INCLUDE . FEELING SO REAL, TRACKS 5 AND 6, ANTHEM, ALL FASTER PACED, TO THE SLOWER PACED AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN IT'S COLD I'D LIKE TO DIE, GOD MIOVING OVER THE FACE OF WATERS...

"Yes and No I agree with Dr. Dawkins that much of what people believe in religion is just a myth or the imagination of the original authors. However some of religious myhtology has hidden truths behind them which ancient seers could see intutively but were unable to explain in scientific terms. For example the description that eve was created from adams ribs makes eminet genetic sense. It is possible to create the female genetic code from the male and not vice-versa because the male has both the x and y chromosomes whereas the female does not have the y chromosome. <br /> Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. And inspite of all of Dr. Dawkins arguments it is difficult to explain things like free will, emotions and desires etc. in living things without invoking something mystic from God. Without this mystic component life would not have been possible. A small book called the 'Mystic and the Blossoms' also available here at Amazon explains all this much more eloquently than I could.",0

"Hollywood at its worst Unfortunately, the movie concept and direction are far fetched, superficial and confusing.<br />Except for Jude Law, the performance of the principal actors is simply pityful and it is quite obvious that they haven't understood anything much about the context and spirit of the story.<br />Sadly, the whole production is an insult to Leo Tolstoy's wonderful novel.",0

"'A BIBLICAL STORY WORTHY OF A FAR BETTER PRESENTATION' Must admit I was caught in two minds regarding the purchase of this one, the film has<br />been slated by many reviewers and critics, however curiosity got the better of me.<br />This a Biblical tale -<br />'Noah' (Russell Crowe) and his wife 'Naameh' (Jennifer Connelly) scrape a living from<br />the baron landscape with their children.<br />'Noah' son of 'Seth' has always believed what his father had taught him as a child, and<br />has endeavoured to follow the path of his beliefs and faith.<br />He has a dream that he believes to be a message from God, he has visions of the World<br />being flooded to rid the planet of the evil that has flourished.<br />'Noah' seeks out his Great Grandfather, 'Methuselah' (Must admit without knowing he was<br />actually in the film, I knew 'Methuselah' had to be played by 'Anthony Hopkins' who else ? )<br />to make sense of his dreams and understand what has to be done.<br />'Noah' has to build an 'Ark' a construction large enough to house two of each creature that<br />walks or fly's, as well of course, to accommodate his immediate family.<br />He has the help of the 'Watchers' (fallen angels from log ago)<br />The King of the land 'Tubal-Cain' (Ray Winstone) who does not believe in miracles, and that<br />man is master of his own destiny, seeks to take charge of the Ark realising the flood 'Noah'<br />talks of is to become a reality.<br />The story on board during the flood a little to 'Hollywood' perhaps, though the film does have<br />it's moments though somewhat fanciful.<br />There of course are some decent Special-Effects along the way...<br />There have certainly been many Biblical drama's superior to this down the years, though I have<br />to say it was a little better than I expected, though, not great.<br />'Glad they remembered the 'Rainbow' at the end.<br />(Many experts have tried to prove or disprove events of the Bible down the years, I believe<br />evidence of a great flood has been found, however, efforts to find any remains of what would<br />need to have been a giant structure - 'The Ark' has not.(Though many believe it landed 16,946 ft<br />up on 'Mount Ararat' East Turkey)<br />Special Features -<br />* Iceland - Extreme Beauty.<br />* The Ark Exterior.<br />* A Battle for 300 Cubits.<br />* The Ark Interior.<br />* Animals Two by Two.any remains of what would<br />need to have been a giant structure - 'The Ark' has not.(Though many believe it landed 16,946 ft<br />up on 'Mount Ararat' East Turkey)<br />Special Features -<br />* Iceland - Extreme Beauty.<br />* The Ark Exterior.<br />* A Battle for 300 Cubits.<br />* The Ark Interior.<br />* Animals Two by Two.",0

"html Let me start by saying that I was highly disappointed with this book in so many ways Review from my blog: http://themadt-party.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/book-review-uglies-by-scott-westerfeld.html<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I was highly disappointed with this book in so many ways. I had such high hopes for this because I usually like what's popular in the book community, but this book and I were just not a match at all.<br /><br />The premise of the book sounded so good and therefore had such potential to deliver... and it did at the start where there was some world building happening, which I really enjoyed. But then as soon as Shay runs away everything got a bit bland. There is a large section of the book spent on a journey and it was honestly really boring to read. This may be because Tally was the only character throughout the journey and I didn't warm to her in the slightest. She actually irritated me most of the time as it felt like she was either caring too much or too little about the wrong things. It also baffled me that Tally was having such a difficult time in choosing whether to turn Shay in or not, as their friendship didn’t even seem that great to me and so I would expect her to want to do anything to get to Peris, who has been her best friend for years. Overall I didn't particularly like any of the characters, except for David as there wasn't really much depth to any of them but him, which I so desperately crave in books.<br /><br />When the journey was finally over the book picked up again because Westfield is good at creating new settings. But quickly things deteriorated with the first case of insta-love that has every truly bothered me. It just felt unnatural and out of the blue. Then things got worse when there were reveals that were meant to be game changing but just fell flat to me as I felt they were fairly obvious. I guessed what was going to happen at the ending too but that was more of a pivotal moment than the previous ones, and actually spiked my interest. But I had to wait until the end of the novel!!!<br /><br/>I did pick up the second book in the series to see if it got better and was a good way in, but put it down and doubt I'll ever pick it back up because I’m just not invested in the story or the characters. I'm truly heartbroken that I didn't like this series.",0

"Gripping, a page turner! I read this in a day. I just assumed SJ Watson is female, though obviously not! Perhaps because it is written in the first person – from a female’s perspective. I found this to be an easy read, definitely a page turner, gripping! I’m not sure how plausible it could be that someone should suffer a trauma to the head and wake up every day feeling completely disorientated and not knowing who they are. It does seem a bit far fetched to me but for the purpose of the story I think it works well. Themes which quickly emerge are trust, instinct, deceit and love. Can Christine trust Ben? Can she trust Dr Nash? She has to differentiate between her own memories and those which have been planted in her head by others. On one of the very first pages of the journal she writes ‘Don’t trust Ben’. This is integral to the story; on one hand she feels she must trust him out of a sense of duty and loyalty – he is her husband and has stood by her, supported her, loves her very much and conceals the truth to protect her. However, on the other hand her instinct tells her that something is not right; his lies have no basis, particularly regarding their son. I thought this battle in her head was conveyed quite well. I did not think the writing was the best; some emotions and thoughts were not expressed  eloquently, it seemed a little bit Mills and Boon in parts. It was also slightly repetitive; ground hog day. Though the author must have felt this necessary in order to prove the point; the fact that Christine really was lost, confused and had no memory of her identity.  I felt an impending sense of fear on her behalf in that Ben was too controlling and I kept hoping that she would not tell him about the journal or Dr Nash and that she really must not trust him!!! So the author achieved the desired effect in this respect! A good twist at the end and the moral of the story – always trust your instinct.",1

"AWFUL, HARMFUL PARENTING ADVICE In this book Tracy Hogg has given terrible parenting advice to new mothers. I cannot begin to explain how the advice in this book ruined my early weeks with my newborn child. Tracy Hogg treats children like they're machines even so far as to say you can categorize their cries - all seasoned parents will know what a ridiculous assumption this is. Over structured routines, her methods are full of contradictions, her 'pick-up put down' just confuses and upsets you and baby - and believe me I did it \\""""correctly.\\"""" Don't let your baby sleep in the car or stroller, don't take baby on errands? What kind of person says these things? Is that real life? Maybe for a celebrity mother - so basically you don't bond with your baby, dont see the world with baby, you're obsessed with baby getting to nap and sleep.    Horrible breastfeeding advice. She even goes as far as to suggest you need to clean your breasts after each feed - what a terrible thing to think, the thought had never crossed mind. She gives this breast feeding advice based on no research, knowledge or education like all of Tracy Hogg's advice. --just to clear-up breast milk naturally contains anti bacterial agents and never in the history of the world have mothers had to disinfect their nipples before and after breast feeding.    This book is harmful for new parents and their babies. Please go with the other one star reviews. I don't think any book in the history of Amazon has ever had this many one star reviews and having experienced it myself I now know why. We should have destroyed this book weeks before we did. Tracy Hogg has no qualifications and only 1980's babysitting experience with bottle feeding celebrity mothers - which just goes to show that ANYONE can write and publish a parenting book. Awful advice.    This book, title and all, is aimed at apprehensive new parents who think maybe there is a \\""""secret\\"""" that they don't know - there isn't! Good advice will tell you your baby is yours and you WILL know what isbest trust your own judgment and your family will be happy - advice as strong as Hogg's is only bad.    Unfortunately Tracy Hogg is no longer with us so she cannot answer for this book and to all the parents that have been so affected by her terrible words. I cannot wait to see this book removed from the shelves.  DO NOT BUY.",0

"Reads like Fan-Fiction For those of you who are unfamiliar with fan-fiction, it is merely there for individuals to dwell on the `what if's' of their favourite story, book, TV show, films. Etc. This book did read to me like a work of fan-fiction. Initially when I heard of the book I imagined a book consisting of pride and prejudice characters that had developed forming a new plot. I was not expecting to read an abridged version to pride and prejudice with a mediocre plot. Over the years, I have come to theorised Austen's work into a manner that is more applicable to me however with this novel it seemed that the writer was trying to push down my throat her own theories behind the characters actions. This is either a brilliant fan-fiction or a waste of space on my bookshelf; the reader can decide. I Highly recommend getting this book from the library before making the full £18.99 purchase (or cheaper depending on the bookshop) as this books really reminds me of marmite: you'll either love it or hate it but its better to try it before committing.",0

"GOODBYE TO ALL THAT!!! Many Marillion fans and critics would have you believe that 'Brave' is the bands finest hour and I've never really agreed. 'Brave' is a very bold and creative album that shows the band flying in the face of fashions, trends and current vogues as usual. It also benefits from an outstanding production. Having said that, it still doesn't quite match the majesty of Marillion's other conceptual albums like 'Misplaced Childhood', 'Clutching At Straws' and even 'Afraid Of Sunlight'.  Several of the tracks on offer here are quite glorious. 'Runaway' and the epic 'The Great Escape' are classic, vintage Marillion tracks packed with bitter sweet emotion and fantastic guitar work from Steve Rothery. Steve Hogarth's vocal displays on these tracks alone are staggeringly good.  'Hard As Love', 'Paper Lies' and the catchy 'Alone Again In The Lap Of Luxury' show the band rocking out with some awesome power.  The title track is a wonderfully atmospheric piece with a Clannad feel to it.  Unfortunately the rest of the album is a little ho hum for me. 'Living With The Big Lie' is too big and overblown for me. 'Goodbye To All That' is a popular live number but is a messy album track despite some decent atmosphere in the instrumental section. Hogarth's mutterings during the track also grate as you can barely tell what he's saying.  'The Hollow Man' is quite possibly my least favourite Marillion track. That this dirge was selected as a single helps to explain Brave's lack of commercial success. To expect media and radio coverage with a song so bleak is insane.  'Made Again' is also highly forgettable and appears more like an add on track to try and lift the dark tone of the record.  There's no doubt that the band worked their socks off to try and create a masterpiece that would lay the still present ghosts of Fish to rest. However, the final result always leaves me feeling a little empty inside, despite one or two fabulous moments.  Having said all that, the live shows in support of 'Brave' way back in 1994 rank amongst my all time favourite Marillion performances, due in no small part to the Fish-like drama and theatrics of Steve Hogarth, who had certainly made the front man berth his own by that stage.  In short then, 'Brave' is a good effort and a solid addition to the Marillion cannon with a thought provoking story, but it's not quite the masterwork that it is commonly perceived to be.",0

"NATURE VS NURTURE William Landay's DEFENDING JACOB has received a lot of hype from its publishers and has been compared to Scott Turows \\""""Presumed Innocent\\"""". Personally, this tale of the fourteen year old son of an Assistant D.A. accused of murdering a classmate put me more in mind of the William March book THE BAD SEED.<br /><br />Several of Landay's characters lack flesh on their bones and the actions of some are downright unbelievable. The Jacob character must be based upon the Sphinx (he is that inscrutable) or perhaps he takes after his father Andy, who has managed to keep a secret from his wife for fourteen years. The wife,Laurie, seems to want to be the perfect mother and anything less than achieving this perfection means she is a failure and \\""""to blame\\"""" for any of her sons problems. The actions of the victim as he was being murdered were implausible at best. Jacob's grandparents seem to be MIA(yet another item that was hard to believe). Then we have Andy's \\""""friend\\"""" who is trying the case. His \\""""go for the throat\\"""" tactics are not the actions of a friend and the political maneuvering in this sticky case is a stomach turning sight to behold. Of course, the story is being related by just one person whose outlook, we know, is skewed.<br /><br />Those observations aside I will admit that this would be the type of selection that any book club group would jump on since it presents any number of avenues to explore and topics for discussion.....and perhaps that was the author's goal. Some of the questions that came to mind as I read were (1) What lengths would a parent go to in order to protect their child from a murder charge? (2) is there any scientific validity in \\""""behavioural genetics\\"""" - - in other words are certain people born with a \\""""murder gene\\"""" and therefore driven to commit certain crimes and therefore not truly responsible for their actions - - Nature versus nurture? (3) how biased is the media in reporting sensational stories and does their version shape public opinion ? (4) does placing a child in nursery school create children with RAD (reactive attachment disorder)? (5) What is the effect of social media on our society? While there was some food for thought presented, I am still less than enthusiastic about this book.<br /><br />Final Analysis: The family secrets are over the top on the believability meter, for an intelligent man the father was obtuse when it came to his son, the courtroom drama is less than dramatic, the protagonists recounting of the case is about as exciting as reading a court transcript of a manufacturer being sued for soap that didn't get the laundry clean enough, and a majority of the characters are about a flat as the paper dolls I played with as a child. All I can say is, Mr. Landay definitely owes a big thank you to his publicist. 2 1/2 stars.es placing a child in nursery school create children with RAD (reactive attachment disorder)?

"Good characters and promising plot...just a little slow paced Things I liked:    - the concept of werewolves turning when it gets cold. It's a somewhat unique idea that I haven't heard before, and it makes everything more urgent than a simple 'moon transformation' as any day could be a chilly one!  - The connection between Sam and Grace is incredibly heart warming...if a bit creepy she was practically in love with a wolf at first!  - the front cover! ( had to mention it =D )  - the characters have some depth to them and have minds of their own!  - the action that was included was good    things I didn't like so much:    - incredibly slow paced compared to other books I have read in the past. Left me getting bored after a while.  - Not much explanation into the werewolves....well not enough for me anyway xD  - Pretty unrealistic in places...apart form the werewolves thing  - Love story a bit TOO convenient? I don't like 'love at first sight =.=' even if he was a wolf when she 'fell in love'...I like a development of feelings.  - Hardly any action at all.  - Not enough of that white wolf!! ( read and you'll know what I mean! ) she came around about 2 or 3 times and she is explained but she never turns up again!    If you're happy with slow and steady, and like a nice romance, then this is for you! If you want hard core action and high speed narration then it isn't xD I am in between the 2 so I give this 3 stars!",0
"Not Laugh Out Loud Funny AND.... To be perfectly honest, I had higher expectations for this movie given that it stars the classic dynamic duo of Pegg and Frost, but I was somewhat slightly disappointed. I think the potential of the idea of a couple of British space geeks travelling to the US for a comic convention and coming across a real live space alien could have really been a side splitter! Don't get me wrong there are parts where it was funny, but I guess I came into this movie with my own preconceptions because to the two star actors' track records.    For me, the character of Paul and his behaviour is true to character, in the sense that you would expect that kind of behaviour from an alien who has been living amongst people in a secret base somewhere for so many years... he's gotten slightly comfortable with human culture and understands the human mindset. Not sure I liked Seth Rogan voicing Paul... I think there are better voices out there... can't really name any right now, but if I really give it a think I'm sure I could come up with a few. Is it just me or is Paul slightly obsessed with showing his family jewels?    Not sure I really liked or understood the scenes where Nick Frost is jealous of Paul for spending time with his best mate Simon Pegg, he's straight and he's jealous of another alien guy for spending time with his mate? Huh!? (upset, feeling let down, lonely, abandoned these I can understand)    I did enjoy Kristen Wiig's character where she wants to break free and live freely, but is completely new to the whole thing... it's funny where she tries to curse.    One tiff I can't seem to get over with this movie is that it is, in a sense, blasphemous... evolution! There is clear and obvious swipe at religion in this movie which I did not appreciate.    Overall a funny movie, but if you really want to enjoy it you have to forget all preconceptions, especially those relating to movies like Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. Again, funny but not laugh out loud funny.",0

"Worst Book Ever Can I give this book zero for being the worst I have ever read?  I cannot think of one good thing to say about it.  The characters are cardboard, the plot ludicrous and I struggled to read it.  I had to keep stopping it was so bad.  Took me about 2 weeks to get through it, hoping that it would improve.  It has the worst line of dialogue to appear in  print, when they discover the key to opening something, along the lines of \\""""It's in English, my native language\\"""".  I heard that he sent his wife to do the on-the-spot research.  I think she went shopping in Paris instead because none of the routes make any sense.  His knowledge of the Eurpean Union is zero too.  Sir Leigh would not be obliged to smuggle French produce into England.  Free movement of goods in a common market.  Well, American writers usually get their facts wrong when it comes to life in Britain and Europe, and their editors are just as ignorant.  No respect for readers.

"Maestro Nicola Luisotti Saves This Sorry Production I Masnadieri was staged in San Carlo two years after the world premiere in London in 1849 for a run of 14 performances and never again until this production from March 2012. The opera was rarely performed until a successful concert performance by the Opera Orchestra of New York in 1975 and the issue of a Philips recording with Bergonzi, Caball&eacute;, Cappuccilli and Raimondi, conducted by Lamberto Gardelli. Bonynge conducted it at the Sydney Opera House in 1980 and recorded it for Decca in 1982 with his late wife.<br /><br />According to the blu-ray's book this blu-ray was compiled from all 5 performances in the run. Nicola Luisotti was recently appointed music director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, and this production is the first he conducted since his appointment. Gabriele Lavia, a well-known Italian director of high repute, as well as an actor, directed it. He is considered a 'specialist' of Schiller's text \\""""Die R&auml;uber\\"""" on which the libretto is based - he directed it (and played the role of Carlo) in a successful 1982 production that toured several Italian towns, and has recently directed a group of young actors in another staging seen in several Italian theatres. He also recently directed this play in one of the major theatres in Rome. In 1986 he produced this opera in Pisa, Lucca and Livorno. So this production of the Teatro San Carlo has generated considerable interest and has attracted fans from all over Italy.<br /><br />In this staging the entire opera takes place in a single ugly space, possibly an abandoned contemporary theater stage with exposed lighting apparatus, projectors everywhere, or a space in an urban ghetto in Harlem or the Bronx with a broken roof, scattered debris and dead leaves . Colorful graffiti and murals (\\""""city painting\\"""") \\""""decorate\\"""" the brick walls; in the background is a large skull with the words \\""""libert&agrave; o morte\\"""" spread out. The libretto needs all the help it can get but setting all the action in the same space doesn't clarify the story and is confusing. The ugly costumes are a puzzling hodgepodge. The principal characters are in late-nineteenth-century style; the all male chorus of the masnadieri is in some kind of gangsters' style with leather coats and hats in matching and mismatching styles - from cylinder to bowler hats; the guests of Francesco party in punk or in cheap party wigs and Halloween costumes. There is a jarring mismatch between the postmodern sets and costumes on the one hand, and the acting characterized by conventional melodramatic operatic poses on the other hand. It creats some risible dramatic situations. There is a pervasive poverty of ideas on how the characters should interact or how the chorus should move on stage. Relationships are not clarified. It looks like the director just threw in the towel on the stupid libretto. It is depressing to watch this unrelenting and baffling ugliness for two hours with no change of scenes (or to watch close-ups of the soprano's heavy perspiration).<br /><br />The four principals and the choir respond better to the conductor than to the director. Tenor Aquiles Machado as Carlo has a true sense of the Verdi style. His delivery is incisive, involved, with emotions clearly projected and lines beautifully shaped and articulated. He is a lyric singing a dramatic role here, but everyone has been singing up a vocal fach for years now (a fach or two: I just learned that J. D. Florez is to take up Arnold in Guglielmo Tell! A tenore di grazia!). The role of Amalia was created for Jenny Lind, the Swedish dramatic coloratura soprano and was written to display her particular strengths. It therefore requires considerable coloratura agility, facility with the fioriture but also dramatic power of projection. Soprano Ana Lucrecia Garc&iacute;a has all of these in spades. She has a pretty stunning technical capability (trills are inconsistent, though) and a full, gorgeous tone. Verdi has a way of somehow \\""""announcing\\"""" in the beginningof a singer's part the special challenge or requirement of a role. Here he put a few bars into Amalia's first appearance a quickly ascending scale that sounds completely out of context in that spot other than to immediately announce his expectations (or allow the soprano to immediately dazzle?). Garc&iacute;a executes it perfectly and effortlessly, touching each note (rather than just gliding over the notes as C. used to do...). This is a sign of things to come in the rest of Garc&iacute;a's elegant assumption of the role. She is still very young and has a way to go to acquire that artistic intelligence that goes with the individuality of expression of more experienced divas. No comments about the rest of the cast or the chorus.<br /><br />This opera is like a bullet train: the score has no digressions or redundancies and the story, with its grimness and aggression once started, goes forward directly without hesitation to its absurd end. Nicola Luisotti captures this breathless pulse of the score with rhythmic vitality, dramatic vivacity, urgency of expression and superbly calculated rallentandos and rubatos in its more lyrical and introspective moments. The orchestra plays for him in a state of grace with clear sonorities and balance between various orchestral sections. Luisotti is the real star of this production.<br /><br />Blu-ray technical quality is fine in terms of video quality and sound. The singers are body miked. I noticed that performances where the singers are body miked sound better on headphones. The advantage of good speakers over even the best headphones is the soundstage they provide, but body mics kill the soundstage anyway. Sound engineers deconstruct the sound to a gazillion tracks and reconstruct some artificial mix according to their skills, preferences and available time. With body mics the result is sterile. This is another example of the maxim that the more toys sound engineers have available to play with the worse the outcome. There are (for now) clips from the production on youtube.

another pointless re-issue sometimes i find re-issue's of popular albums by bands and solo stars welcoming but wasn't this album re-issued somthing like six years ago!   nothing against one of Elvis Costello's best ever album since il buy it and see if the re-issue is worth the price alone especially the 2nd disc but if anybody takes a look at the Beatles back catalogue and see why it hasn't undergone somthing of a facelift is the reason why they (or the two suviving beatles in question) are loaded and don't see why they want to con the fans out of their hard earned money for the sake of putting their albums under the knife!,0

"Very Disappointing and Too Slow I was very disappointed with this book, and I have been an ardent Stephen King fan for years. I found it much too slow, excessively padded out (why does he ramble on and on at times, to the detriment of the plot action, when just a few short paragraphs would do?) and interminable, with very little happening and far too much emphasis on the political. I also found the time travel aspect a little far fetched, and at times somewhat confusing (didn't like the idea of the event being reset each time you went back). But most disappointing of all, there was absolutely NO horror in this book, and it just leads me to wonder if King is moving away from the horror genre permanently. I sincerely hope not, as I want him to go back to writing the more sensational shockers like Salem's Lot and The Shining, with which he first stamped his mark as a horror writer. I became so bored with this lackluster book that I skipped through it to the end to find out whether or not he did actually thwart the Kennedy assassination. Admittedly, when I first saw this book on sale, I did have some reservations that it might not be the kind of horror tale we always expect from King. However, I did venture to buy it in the hope of reading a good story. Unfortunately, as it turned out, my initial reservations about this book proved to be correct, and I would even go as far as to say that, after Lisey's Story (which, again, I never finished), it is the worst King book I have ever read. Let us hope that for his next book - which, I believe, is a sequel to The Shining - he returns to the good old out-and-out horror that he always used to do so well.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0096NS4VY Horror Stories]]",0

"Produced, directed and acted by people who have clearly never read Austen... This film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you have ever read the book you will be shocked at the amount of 'americanising' put into this dreadful adaptation. Knightly spends most of her time in a state of undress, Darcy mopes around and ruins some of the best lines from the book, and the chemistry between the two of them has a modern one-night feel to it. Avoid.",0

"Just okay but that's okay I've been a fan since 1980, when I first heard the live album If You Want Blood and the song Riff Raff changed my life. I always buy the albums, always go and see them live and rank them as my favourite band. Whenever a new album is on the way, I'm always hoping they might just deliver one more anthem, or maybe even one more classic album. Alas, it rarely happens.<br /><br />Since For Those About To Rock (in my opinion the last truly great, consistent album they made), they've released albums which have mainly been a couple of standout tracks surrounded by a lot of forgettable ones. For me, one of the problems has been a combination of poor lyrics and melodies, and occasionally awful production (their self-produced efforts Flick Of The Switch and Fly On The Wall being the worst sounding of all, with cardboard box drums, no bass and muddy guitars). To be fair to Brendan O'Brien, you can't fault his production. It's big, crisp and beautifully balanced, with bass and drums driving things along nicely. As with Black Ice, he's gotten a great performance out of Johnson again. A couple of the songs are decent - Hard Times and Baptism By Fire. A couple are just re-workings of older songs - Rock or Bust's riff is the same as Nervous Shakedown and the verse melody in Rock the Blues Away is identical to Anything Goes from Black Ice (seriously, note for note). A couple of them are bad - Dogs of War and Sweet Candy. The lyrics to Play Ball are so bad, I find it hard to listen to; despite the catchy guitar work. Angus may be one of the greatest guitarists ever to pick up the instrument and one of the best riff-makers of all time, but he's no Bon Scott when it comes to telling a rock n roll tale. But hey, it's an AC/DC album. It's not meant to be intellectually stimulating or thought provoking. It's meant to get you moving, singing along, headbanging and duck-walking. Trouble is, there's no Heatseeker, no Thunderstruck, no Who Made Who, no Stiff Upper Lip, no Rock n Roll Train. The album just passes me by with only the flash of a riff or a lick or a chorus or a bridge to grab my attention here and there.<br /><br />And yet, does that matter? Not really. I didn't expect that much; especially given the circumstances regarding Malcolm. Not many bands could say they produced one classic, enduring album, never mind five or six. The fact that this album isn't as good as Back In Black or Highway To Hell or Powerage or Let There Be Rock isn't a surprise or a problem to me. It's a passable AC/DC album - better than Fly On The Wall or Ballbreaker but not as good as Razor's Edge or Flick Of The Switch - and I'll enjoy the couple of tracks they play from it live on tour.",0

"Foos come out Fighting The latest great album from one of my favourite bands. At first I didn't get all the hype over the eight 'movie episodes' until I watched them, then understood. Each track was recorded in a seminal studio in a different town/city across the US, giving an individual sound and feeling to them all. The lyrics were added during the recording using facts, local history and memoirs of people interviewed. Ground breaking stuff, yet the album keeps regular Foo fans happy with the quality they expect. Cannot recommend this enough and while you wait for the cd to arrive in the post you can download the tracks to start playing them immediately - brilliant, what more can a I say?",1

"Patronising, implausible rubbish I hated this book and I only finished it because it's my book club read.  I also hoped and prayed the ending might redeem itself but it was SO predictable. Enid Blyton - jolly hockey sticks does death and starvation. Single woman has baby out of wedlock in the forties and is admired and loved for it?  Not likely.  With a German soldier?  Ridiculous.  Islander then goes to France to bring back dead mother's friend who nobody has ever met before?  Hmm....I doubt it, she could have been anyone.  Nosey Brit comes to island and is immediately loved by everyone and is allowed to look after and adopt the dead mother's precious child.  Jesus, God give me strength to finish this book!",0
cool But it a bit hard to trun,1
"Not so much 'The Lost Symbol' more 'The Lost Plot' I had a very strong sense of deja-vu reading this book.  Robert Langdon becomes embroiled in trying the uncover the secrets of the Freemasons by deciphering the coded messages contained within the closely guarded Masonic Pyramid whilst on a jaunt around the major landmarks of Washington DC in order to save his long time friend and Master Mason who has been held hostage by the villain of the piece, whilst accompanied by the hostage's brilliant scientist sister. Does this all sound a bit familiar? Well it should, because it's basically the Da Vinci code with the Roman Catholic church substituted for the Freemasons, moved from Paris and London to Washington DC. There are the same coded symbols, mathematical puzzles, and lectures on artistic symbolism that we know so well. The plot is also something of a conjuring trick, because we realise at the end that there is no great secret. The solution of the coded pyramid takes us to what is basically a rather trite conclusion and appears to be already known to Peter Solomon, the guardian of the Masonic Pyramid. Therefore, when all is revealed the whole plot becomes a bit of a 'so what'. A very disappointing conclusion.<br /><br />The book contains a lot of factual information and descriptions of buildings in Washington DC, reading in many places like a guide book and pages from Wikipedia. The Washington DC tourist board will no doubt be raising a few glasses to Mr Brown. Not being very familar with the lay out of central Wasington DC, a map included in the front of the book would have been useful to me.<br /><br />There has been a lot of criticism of Brown's writing style, which is no doubt very sensationalist with lots of hyperbole and over the top descriptions and adjectives. However, the result is undoubtedly a great pager turner despite the fact that it ultimately leads absolutely nowhere. As usual characterisation isn't a very strong point. Robert Langdon's two dimensional cardboard cut-out character in tweed jacket and suede loafers only serves to make the main villain, the deranged and tatooed Mal'akh, seem uneven more implausible. The vertically challenged CIA Director is almost as equally unbelievable. In fact, the whole plotting is really pretty unbelievable! Towards the end of the book Robert Langdon survives a near death experience which would have put most people in a hospital bed for a few days at least, but not our tweed-jacket and chino-clad symbol cracking super sleuth! Oh, no! He just dries himself off and resumes his relentless charge around Washington DC, together with Peter Solomon who almost as miraculously levers himself out of his wheel chair minus a hand. The identity of the villain Mal'akh, which turns out to be a major twist in the story, is telegraphed in the extreme. Was there anyone who didn't work this out??<br /><br />I note there are some lists of 'great' (or not so great!) Dan Brown sentences complied from his previous works. From this novel three favourites I managed to find were;<br />P285 - \\""""The Upper West Side apartment offered breathtaking views of Central Park. Andros has chosen it because the sea of green outside his window reminded him of his lost view of the Adriatic.\\""""  I can picture the similarity only too readily: the sun, the sand, the sea, the tavernas etc..... In any case as Andros went to the Greek Islands I assume he actually meant the Aegean or Ionian Seas.<br />P314 - \\""""That's why science has advanced more in the last five years than the last five thousand.\\""""  Can anyone remember the dark days of 2004? Really, Dan, are you 'aving a laugh!??<br />P440 - \\""""According to Nola's spec sheet, the UH60 had a chassis-mounted, laser-sighted, six-gigahertz magnetron with a fifty-dB-gain horn that yielded a ten giga-Watt pulse.\\""""  Blimey! I wonder if I can get one of those on E-Bay!????<br /><br />In conclusion, it is the rather familiar formula which has made DB such a popular author. Very readable, very unbelievable, with a very anti-climatic ending,involving secret code-breaking, artistic symbolism, pyramids and (again) Sir Isaac Newton.<br /><br />For the next installment, I'm putting my money on Robert Langdon charging around London (replete in tweed jacket, loafers and Mickey Mouse watch....of course) in search of Lord Lucan, deciphering hidden clues on Cleopatra's Needle and the National Gallery that will lead him to Central America, the lost treasures of the Aztecs and Lord Lucan himself living in a cardboard box at the top of Chichen Itza temples.

"What is Murakami up to? What a peculiar book.  Sprawling, full of digressions and implausible plotting and characterisation, it's still a strangely diverting and interesting novel.  I'd agree with a review in the NY Times podcast: it's either a terrible, great novel or vice versa.  It has echoes of and allusions to any number of (mostly American) writers - Murakami's usual suspects - Chandler and Carver seem to be strong influences; not much Orwell, as far as I could see.

I was so bored I kept losing concentration so information might have got lost on me. Very possibly it did. I listened for 3 agonizing hours before I gave up. The first story was ok, it kept me on edge a bit because I was very interested in what the guy will find outside the silo, while I was hoping it wouldn't turn out to be another version of the movie \\""""The Island\\"""". But the second one! The plot seemed to be like this: two people climb stairs and then climb some more stairs and then climb an awful lot of stairs. They meet some other people and talk a lot but so little is happening and after 3 hours I got to know so little about where the story was going that I was unable to listen any more.",0

"Awful reissue You don't have to go far only to the Salvo records reissue of the Nazareth catalog to see what could have been.Beautiful digipack with a nice booklet contains the story of the album.With all the Queen albums the reissues are butchered totally.Not even the original release date noted anywhere.There is not a single word about the making of any of the albums.The jewel case is the one what you can not buy separately so if it is broken you can not even replace them.The bonus tracks are so lame,it hurts.Yes the sound is good,so the remastering itself is great,but the packaging just sucks.It is disgusting how they did not put any effort into this project.Just like the Beatles remasters,the Queen remasters could have been the same way.The different is those people cared.These morons did not.When I put 1 star to rate this album I really meant this reissue.The music is still 5 stars.",0

"I think I am going to stop now I loved the first three books but have found the introduction of so many (often irrelevant) characters to be confusing and the sub-plots spaced too far apart.  Having got this far I thought I would read the whole series but now I have read in reviews that Martin has not yet finished the story, I don't think I will.  I am frustrated at the way interesting key characters are killed off at a stroke.  Reading in a review of the last written book that Jon dies has finished this for me.  Agree with all comments about editing to shorter versions, plus there are no chapter headings or contents pages if you wish to refer to a previous chapter to refresh - and there are long gaps between character's chapters.<br /><br />All in all I have decided to switch to Ken Follet Pillars of the Earth for my epic medieval literary fix.........<br /><br />I don't normally give up on a book series but this has beaten me - shame.",0
"George R R Martin's Dracula! This movie was a long time in gestation. Alex Proyas was supposed to direct a good 10 years ago. At that point it was called Dracula Year Zero and he wanted a bloody R Rated medical epic. Universal weren't so convinced. They wanted more fantasy and supernatural elements, so the project went cold. A few years later they rewrite the script and turn Vlad The Impaler into a cursed but romantic prince and bring in a new director (Gay Shore) and we get Dracula Untold. So, is it any good. Actually, it's a good looking film with some fairly interesting ideas. It basically takes the 4 minute prologue from Bram Stoker's Dracula and expands it to 90 minutes. It doesn't really add anything new to the vampire or Dracula legend but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching. Firstly, Luke Evans is every bit the leading man. He has the looks and the acting talent but the script doesn't really give him a lot to sink his teeth into! He acts tormented from time to time, but this is really a superhero version of Dracula, so he's a bit dumbed down and, sadly, de-fanged. Dracula makes a deal with a cave dwelling Nosferatu to become powerful monster so that he can defeat his enemies and save all of Transylvania. But there's a price: the monster he must become has an insatiable thirst for human blood and it proves impossible for Dracula to resist, thus dooming him for all eternity. So that's really the story. The fantasy / supernatural elements are handled really well - Dracula's bat transformation is brilliant. But I would have liked to have seen Dracula become more murderous and bloodthirsty - the way the real Vlad was. But there are some great action sequences with lots of battles which does give it an almost epic feel at time. In fact, it's pretty clear that Univeral wanted something that resembled the look and feel of the popular Game Of Thrones fantasy series instead of an outright horror movie. Which is a bit of a shame. The other interesting thing is that Universal do have a big appetite to resurrect it's other classic monsters. I think there was some intention of connecting this movie with what else they have planned (the ending of this movie heavily points to a bigger universe). I wouldn't mind seeing Luke Evan's return to the role, just so long as they have him behaving more like Stoker's monster in any sequel instead of the heroic and dashing knight he is in this.",0

"Great game but extras are unnecessarily expensive! Angry Bird racing game was great but the cost of upgrades and cars was astronomical.  I was instantly turned off.  This is a bit more balanced and it seems you aren't too gimped by not investing.  However, there seems little for the user that wants to invest a few quid but that seems standard with mobile/tablet games nowadays. That is a shame.<br /><br />What Rovio have done is create a fairly in depth rpg that outclasses many other games - especially on the kindle. However, I'd be more tempted with something like dragon quest 8, where you won't be stung with extras further down the line or forced to invite facebook friends just to play on a level playing field. I understand companies need to make money but I'm losing my love of games that are pay-to-win especially when the game is above par to begin with just charge us a fiver up front :(<br /><br />My recommendation? Buy DQ8 if you've never played it, or get this and perhaps prepare to grind and play for free.",0

"If only it could be erased from existence One of the biggest cinematic disappointments of all time, it's such a shame that this film and the other two prequels can't be erased from human existence and memory.<br /><br />In one viewing a friend and I noted over 100 problems with this film. One of the most major is that there are no characters. Without describing their clothing, try and describe any of the so called 'characters' in this film. Now do the same for the original trilogy. See what I mean?<br /><br />The pod race is contrived to bring some action in order to inject something interesting into what is otherwise one of the most dull storylines ever. Think of the starts of Episodes 4-6 and then compare the start of this film - dull may be an understatement.<br /><br />There are just so many things wrong with this film that it would take a book to go into them. The new description of the Force given by Qui-Gon Jinn is frankly ridiculous and clashes with Yoda's far more mystical explanation in The Empire Strikes Back. In fact, Jinn's very presence in the film clashes with Obi-Wan's words to Luke in 'Empire' when telling him that Yoda was the Jedi Master that taught him.<br /><br />I'm going to have to leave this review here because the more I talk about this film the more annoyed I get that it ever got made. If you want to see a fantastic review that covers a lot of interesting points, then check out the one at redlettermedia.com - hilarious (and I must admit I borrowed the above character description idea from it because it is so true).",0

"Damaging storyline Excellent quality book. Dispatch time fine.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have looked into the story before buying though. The story is about a child who writes to the zoo requesting a pet. The zoo sends several animals but none of them meet the child's expectations - too big, too tall, too grumpy etc. The child subsequently sends back each animal until he gets a puppy which is &#34;perfect&#34;.<br /><br />It gives the impression that it is OK to give things back for trivial reasons. As someone who grew up in foster care, this isn't something I really want to read to my son. Ok for a younger child where the parents can just make animal noises but the content of the story is not suitable for chidren, particularly those in care/adopted children with stability issues. Also, not the best story to encourage children that pets are for life.",0
Five Stars Excellent film in good condition,1
"Pink may have lost her mojo. This album is terrible. There is one track I enjoy, maybe 2 that are bareable and the rest are awful. The lyrics are imature and Pinks usual stunning voice is masked by silly computer editing. As a Pink fan, I expected far better-it feels like she has lost her mojo.",0
"Dull This book was recommended to me by several different people who stated it was brilliant and a must read! Well I thought it was a waste of time, throughout the whole book I wasnt gripped at all, the style of writing was monotonous and after a book full of stories throughout the characters lives for it to end the way it did I thought was terrible. I cant believe it has been made into a film.",0

"I tried... But gave up I made it to 100 pages. For me, page turner this was not. The story wasn't engaging enough for me to carry on, prize or no prize. I had no problem with Walter Moody or any of the other twelve in that hotel, the plot seemed promising, but the style of writing got in the way. It's quite rambling with verrrry long sentences. So what, you might ask, but it was getting a wee bit ridiculous, with five, seven, ten lines going by and still no indication the sentence would end. Catton loves commas, that's for sure! Best part of four pages to describe Moody standing in a doorway. Get on with it already! Anyway, by 100 pages it was a little better, but there was not enough going on for me to want to keep reading. Picked up [[ASIN:1780222858 The Prisoner of Heaven]] by Carlos Ruiz Zafon and [[ASIN:1408842424 And the Mountains Echoed]] by Khaled Hosseini instead. Beautiful storytelling that I can't wait to keep reading, and for me, no contest!",0

"not bad I think as far as PE albums go, they reached their peak with 'It Takes A Nation Of Millions...'. There's alot to be said for this album too - with a few real standout tracks (most notably 'Fight The Power') - but it just doesn't seem as focused. The sound is very busy and urgent, which isn't always agreeable, and at times I think it even sounds a bit messy, Chuck D's vocals - though always good - are also a bit hard to make out at points. Still, it's worth owning for the few standout tracks there are and as a less accomplished companion piece to their better previous release.",0

"Sad End To A Career I have been a Pink Floyd fan for nearly 30 years and have loyally bought all the albums even the progressively weaker post Waters albums but this is a Sad End. If you like Dave Gilmours self indulgent noodling on a guitar this album is for you, if you want Floyd then avoid. The 18 songs on this album are just outakes from what was Floyds weakest album The Division Bell, writing lyrics was never Gilmours strongest point and it shows on this album, only one of these songs has actually got any lyrics, its like Gilmour decided that as long as it was branded Pink Floyd we would all rush out and buy this album of poor instrumentals.<br />How some people have given this five stars is beyond me, where are those memorable songs like Shine On, Us and Them, Comfortably Numb, wheres the bite that came with Money, Welcome to the Machine, Run like Hell etc, this is nothing but a collection of truly poor forgettable songs.<br />Its taken me many years to realise it, but Pink Floyd died the day Roger Waters left.",0

"Lauren Oliver’s writing is a masterpiece The concept of love being a disease drew me in straight away, and with the hundreds of amazing reviews it was a no brainer whether I wanted to read it. I don’t know why I put off reading it for so long, but I think I was simply intimidated by a 400 page love story.<br /><br />Anyway, now that I finally have I’ll admit that this book started off rather slow and it wasn’t because of the world building, which was actually done fluidly (and the excerpts at the beginning of each chapter from fictional documents about the dystopian world such as The Book of SHHH which is kind of like their bible, kept me interested though it did make me want more of the dystopia side of it) but I think that because it is a dystopian romance novel it didn’t kick-start until the romance did.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver’s writing is a masterpiece, it’s so fluent and beautiful that I wouldn’t be surprised if she could turn a sentence about a dog pooping into something tear-jerking. She writes like a poet, and deserves all the positive feed-back she’s getting from her books. I’m not sure whether it was a good or a bad thing but I preferred her writing to her actual characters, because while her writing was rich with beautiful depth and imagery, her two main characters Lena and Alex were a little flat. I am sure that this will change as the series continues and Lena has already developed so much after one book. She was originally just a simple girl who was a sucker to the rules because she didn’t know any differently, but she is stronger now and throughout her journey you relate to her impeccably. That is why my heart-breaked just as hers did at the end of the book. Now, now, don’t jump to conclusions.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to readers who like love stories over people who like dystopias because I feel as if it fell short in this aspect, but I hope Lauren Oliver will pick this up in book 2 of the Delirium series: Pandemonium. Which I will definitely be reading, even if it’s only to find out the result of the cliff-hanger which has left my heart racing.<br /><br />Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk, even if it’s only to find out the result of the cliff-hanger which has left my heart racing.<br /><br />Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk",0
"An Abundance of Annoyance I did not enjoy this book. I could honestly say, the first three chapters made me laugh out loud, especially as Hassan was first introduced, but after that, there were random moments here and there where I laugh and think \\""""good one Green\\"""", but it's just not up to par with his other books.<br /><br />An Abundance of Katherines is about a child prodigy - Colin - who seems to have dated in one form or another 19 different Katherines (with a K). Not only that, but he's been dumped by most of them. And with his most recent Katherine break up, he is devastated, and thinks very little of himself. In steps the savior best friend, Muslim-Lebanese-American Hassan, who has gotten used to picking up the pieces of his insecure yet unique best friend, Colin. This time's remedy? A road trip!<br /><br />This marks the start of a wonderful, inspiring, self-achieving and self-changing journey for both boys.<br /><br />In Tennessee they meet Lindsey, a loner/turned popular girl who doesn't have many aspirations beyond her little town, and the group of people she knew and grew up with.<br /><br />Colin is obsessed with becoming a \\""""genius\\"""". He is not satisfied with being a child prodigy, but wants to go one step further and become a genius who leaves his mark in the world and is forever known and remembered. In other words, he wants to be famous for his brain. I did not like Colin very much, he is way too self-involved to the point of being really annoying. The maths threw me off a lot of times, and I found it extremely irritating and just skimmed through most of it because I felt like it took away so much from the actual story.<br /><br />Basically, Colin wants to invent a mathematical formula that predicts when relationships will end and who the \\""""dumper\\"""" and \\""""dumpee\\"""" are. His obsession with the whole \\""""Katherine\\"""" thing, and becoming famous, really made me dislike him as a character, which in turn made this story very unattractive.<br /><br />Also, I find this quite funny, because I'm an Arab Muslim myself, but non-Arabs seem to think that the written Arabic is the same as the spoken Arabic. It is not though. We have so many different dialects and accents that we use as our speaking language, and Hassan being Lebanese should have been speaking Lebanese Arabic, and yet he was speaking traditional written Arabic (the language of the Quran, which is very old and not used in speech anymore). It's basically like having a 17 year old American speak medieval English and sound like Shakespeare.<br /><br />All in all, I usually commend John Green for his understanding of teen psyche and drama. And I commend him for creating characters that will always stay with you and who are so memorable and unique in their own way. This time though, I believe the characters were very forgettable - as is this book.k that the written Arabic is the same as the spoken Arabic. It is not though.

"Broken cover, but perfect CD The album itself is a no doubt absolute 5, but what I got delivered was not my expectation. Yes, I did indeed get the album, the sound is absolutely amazing and the CD works with no scratches or anything. The problem is: I got an album that did not have the sealing plastic on the outside, and the album cover has  something that looks like a chewing gum mark. Plus, it is a little broken. I suspect this to be not just an used album, but also a badly used one.<br />Apart from that, Sia's album is so great that I could not give lower than a 3, and I don't really care about the cover.

"A good read but chronologically messy If you want to read this epic of 10 books then you need to be prepared for a complex sequence of events and a vast list of characters to sort out in your mind, plus a few dabbling gods to boot. I'm obliged to say read these books in a different order to which they were published. Do some research first and I think you will enjoy the books a lot more, For example, read book one, then book three, then book two, then book four. This way the books will follow in sequence and not leave you bemused trying to remember who's who and what's what. Having said this, book five goes all the way back to an historic series of events before the first book. Confused? Well you would be entitled to be. I'm at book five stage so I think my advice would be of value to any prospective reader. The books are well written, but also something of an  exercise in the English language with a challenging plot to stretch the mind. The manipulative gods and would-be gods, do disrupt the flow a bit and I'm not sure they always come across as entirely plausible. A bit like some Ancient Greek tales, eg. Clash of the Titans. There are plenty of characters to warm to and follow in their exploits. Nevertheless, the series is deservedly deemed a classic, but I would not recommended it to your average Harry Potter reader. If I manage to finish the series it will be a monumental achievement, but something worth the effort, I'm sure.",1

I would give it 5 stars purely for those very reasons, however the prose is flat and merely functional which does detract a little from the positives.  She tells a good story  and her teenage characters are well drawn and interesting. It's a far better portrayal of working class misery and decay than that managed by Martin Amis in Lionel Asbo, just not as well written. It's just ok, but the disproportionate negativity and unwarranted hysteria is all very amusing.",0

"Disc 2 (The Lost World BD) skipping issue, ruins the film. This review is solely based on the 2nd disc in the set - the two other movies (JP, JP3) were superb and played without error.<br /><br />Finally decided to unpack (bought in 2012 and never opened) my copy and watch all the Jurassic Park films again (to have them fresh in the memory just before going to watch Jurassic World), only to find out halfway through the second movie, that it skips several minutes (at 1:23:59 - the scene with T-Rex inside the tent) during playback. Very disappointing.<br />I can see many people had problem with disc 1, however I could barely find anyone having issues with disc 2 - but I assume it's all due to bad QC.<br />If I look closely on the disc, I can see a tiny hole in the data-layer, so I guess that's why it starts skipping (it will even skip until the next scene if not paused and rewinded).<br /><br />Unfortunately for me there's nothing I can due, as it's been too long since I purchased the boxset.",0
"What. A. Ride! One thing I need to mention before I rant on about how glorious this book is, I have to thank the sometimes over spamming adverts on YouTube for showing the trailer of this movie. Without that impromptu Google search that followed and a quick scout on Amazon, I would never have discovered this book even existed.<br />Normally, my reading habits rarely take me out of the horror genre (King, Barker etc) but I thought I'd give this a punt on purely nothing else but my fascination with space... And Mars particularly. Now, I'm not a 'binge reader' as most people are fond of promoting. I lead a busy, sometimes hectic life, with barely enough time to find to sleep most nights. So I generally read as and when I can which usually means it can take a month or two to finish a good book. The Martian is an exception to that rule. A bank holiday weekend, and a few hours of reading rapidly descended into a marathon session, sacrificing my well earned sleep just to keep the pace with Mark Watney. I finished in two days!<br />The log type style, the humour even the remarkably scientific accuracy of the whole thing simply astounded me. I was captivated and marooned with the lonliest guy in the solar system!<br />Don't get me wrong, this story may not be everybody. Some of the science-fact parts maybe off putting to some would be readers, but otherwise I would recommend this read to anyone who finds it even remotely  interesting. Watney's humour is brilliant and sharp and believable.<br />It's told primarily from a diary/log first person format, as I mentioned earlier, occasionally flicking back to earth as well as some flash forward/sideways commentary. The authors style in the third person does lack a few of the nuances of the more seasoned writers, but it's easily overlooked when you consider he skilfully maintains the pace of the story.<br />I won't give any sploilers away here. It's not fair to any of you would be buyers. If you're considering getting a copy, just do it. Seriously. Don't wait for the movie.<br />As much as I credited the movie trailer at the start of the review, my only hope is they do it justice. The only way you're going to know that for yourself is to read this first.<br />For me, this is easily the best science fact & fiction novel I have ever read.",1
"The Kid's Book Trifecta: Drawings, Rhyme, Story Rarely does a book for little ones hit top marks on the three things that matter most, but this one does - 1) vibrant, clear, colorful and engaging drawings, 2) rhymes that really connect, with strong measures, sophisticated structure, and emphasis and flow that works whether read silently or out loud, 3) a heart warming story with multiple positive messages, (self reliance, friendship, resourcefulness, nerve, imagination, and a general sense of generous good heartedness).<br /><br />Perfect for bedtime, the story starts calmly, leads our snail and whale friends through interesting and exciting adventures, then turns into a rescue drama, moves on to a happy ending, and then winds down with a calm upbeat conclusion. I can feel the grandchild drifting off with a happy smile as the story concludes. Plenty to look at, lots to think about - just a solid, satisfying, engaging and rewarding read for both your youngster and, possibly, you. A very nice choice.",1

"Disappointing Much as I am a great fan or Eric Burdon - a man with a unique, if sometimes flaky, voice -  I am not a great fan of this album.  To give you some indication, despite being a great fan, and despite listening to this CD either intently with the sleeve out (like in the good old vinyl LP days), or simply as background music, I can barely find much to say about it.    In short, this is a shadow of what Eric Burdon was and perhaps the sleeve notes, where it is the producer, not Eric, who thanks the musicians, suggests that the Eric of old simply did not turn up.      Although the lyrics are more introspective and worldy than usual, most of the arrangements are typical for many of Burdon's latter day albums (light bluesy rock).  The voice is Eric with no mistake, but there's no memorable vocal delivery.      Unless you are an avid fan and/or a complete-ist, I suspect you might regret this.  Unfortunately, I am both - and there is only one Eric Burdon.  But as stated above, of all his albums (and I have more or less everyone except for some odd US compilations), this is probably the most forgettable.    The album serves merely as a reminder to go back and listen to some of his great work (mainly pre mid 80's in my view).     Sorry Eric mate. I grew up in the same area as you and your music has been with me since childhood so this review did not come easy.",0
Would have been a five star review..but.. ..&amp;#34;Secret Society&amp;#34; only gets three stars due to it's various methods of getting you to part with your money to progress. Currently I have two pictures blocked by cursed objects..which require special objects to banish them..which I don't have in my inventory..which I could buy if I purchased crystals..but that requires parting with real money to get the crystals. The gold coins you are awarded on completion of each game is a very small amount compared to what is needed to open unlocked pictures and only gets worse the further you progress. But once again this could be rectified if I purchased gold coins..with real money.<br /><br />It's a shame really because the look of &amp;#34;Secret Society&amp;#34; is absolutely stunning and the hunt for the hidden objects on a timer is both enjoyable and frustrating in equal measure. But I am rapidly being turned off playing a game that is consisently looking to dip it's hand in my wallet.,0

Mixed Bag I would say this is Metallica's best album since the Black Album but it's not without it's faults. To start with the good I like the return to the trash sound after the noise that was St Anger. The Day That Never Comes is a superb song that starts slowly and gets heaver and heaver such as classic like One or Sanitarium. Also All Nightmare Long is very catch and wouldn't have been out of place on the first 5.<br /><br />On to the bad. My biggest criticism is the length. It goes on for 70 odd minutes which is way too long. Many of the songs drag. Sometimes less is more. DM dose lack a little verity and the almost 10 minute instrumental Suicide & Redemption is no Orion. Also I don't know what they where thinking doing a third Unforgiven.<br /><br />To conclude if you like Metallica DM is probably just about worth buying. If your new to them but one of their 80s masterpieces first.,0

"A bit disappointed I bought this CD after seeing a recent TV programme about Paul Simon actually making this LP. I realised that I missed my old LP and hearing this glorious music. However, as several reviewers have said, the sound is poor and does not give the atmosphere and impact of the original recording. A few of the later tracks do improve in sound quality, but I shall listen to this CD in the car where the mediocre sound doesn't matter too much.",0

"The pinnacle of Dragonforce and Marc This album really brings out the best in Marc, they keep the fast show off side of Dragonforce that they are known for but as with the album before this they are starting to make the riffs more of a selling point than other albums they have released.<br /><br />The Game starts off the album really well, a good riff driven song, with the backing vocals of Matt (Trivium Frontman) really adding to the song, the chorus is simple but great, and then the solo kicks in and a very recognizable Dragonforce appears, 9/10<br /><br />Tomorrows Kings pushes less of a riff based than The Game but it is more vocal based and it works quite well, and the high note Marc hits before the solo kicks in is really impressive, 7/10<br /><br />No More is like The game in that it pushes more as a riff based song, this is not one of the best songs on the album when compared to the others, it is a good song in it's own right, 5/10<br /><br />Three Hammers is easily (in my opinion) one of the stand out songs on this album, it starts off quiet and slowly builds up, and paying attention the the lyrics it is a really good song, Marc also shows off his vocal range in this, with mid range vocals for the most part but he hits some really high notes aswell, this song just has a really epic feel to it, then the solo starts, the first part of the solo is good but then the second part is where it shines, the tapping and the drums in the background give it a really epic sound, it is bound to give any dragonforce solo fan pure delight, 10/10<br /><br />Symphony of the Night is a strange step as the beginning is not the conventional instrument, the song as a whole is good, where once again Marc shows off his vocals, the main point in this song in my opinion is the vocals and the lyrics, the guitars almost seem like a secondary part in this song<br /><br />The Sun is Dead is (in my opinion) another one of the stand out tracks as they seem to have not focused on the speed of the song but instead made it a really epic song, and by removing the up and front speed they have really made an awesome song, this song is primarily vocal driven but also gives the bass guitar some time to shine in the build up the solo the guitars don't make as much of a frontal attack but when the solo kicks in the works really well, and again by removing the speed they have created a sound that really makes this song stand out, 10/10<br /><br />Defenders is very riff driven and it is evident as soon as the song starts, the vocal range in this song is well demonstrated, the guitars power the song through with the riff based attack and then the solo kicks in and really pushes the old dragonforce sound of guitar solos taking front and center priority, it does not disappoint with the solo in that sense, 8/10<br /><br />Extraction Zone starts off well and shows off more riffs and mixes in little show off bits, this is one of the weaker songs on the album (in my opinion) as the second half of the song doesn't really fit in that well, it starts to redeem itself by throwing in the solo and that is probably the most redeeming thing about this song, it is quite a boring song, they changed their sound on this song but did it in the wrong way, 3/10<br /><br />City of Gold starts of with a nice riff, it then throws in the vocals, in terms of the vocals this is probably one of the more boring songs it is a filler song (in my opinion) it is not as bad as extraction zone though, it does redeem itself with the pre-solo riff, the solo then fully starts and has a really nice feel to it and is a good enough length aswell, 5/10<br /><br />Ring of Fire... it's a cover song and it is a really good cover in that it keeps the original song but also puts the signature dragonforce sound to use on it, it is a really fun song and also a really strange leap, from country to power metal, 9/10<br /><br />In terms of the bonus tracks, well they are what you would expect of bonus tracks, not bad but not quite on par with the album itself<br /><br />My overall feeling about this album is that it is an amazing piece of work, easily on par with Inhuman Rampage, personally i think this is the best album this band have put out, it mixes Speed guitar work, Marcs vocal range and some really epic sounding work, i would highly recommend this album to any dragonforce fan",1

"Attempting to not be ridculously cynical..... crappy pop-tinged metalcore pap! I bought this album based on the 'strength' of Her Voice Resides and 4 Words (to choke upon.) This is understandable; as it was during a period when my musical pallette was sufficiently worse then it is now.<br />To put it lightly, this album is wannabe-Metal, a lamb in wolves clothing. The best tracks, mentioned above, are decent, with mediocore riffing and two decent, albeit short, solos. The resst is absolute emo posh. Lyrically, the album focuses on pathetic teen angst, mainly related to 'relationships' and other such subjects popular amongst those with dyed black hair and a permanent dour expression of attempted misery on their heavily maked-up faces. The singing ranges from a soft, pathetic whine to a 'roar,' with a heavy echo effect to mask the lack of ferocity. The guitarwork is poor, with downtuned two note riffs, with only the above 2 songs having decent riffs. Solos are sparse and two short, however the lead guitarist Padge might have some talent hidden somewhere in the depths.<br />Ignore the hysteria of previous reviewers, like sheep they beg to follow the herd. Instead, listen to the wisdom of a proper Metalhead, and do not waste your money on this awful album",0
"a little weak and transparent This is comedy satire is about Dr Alfred Jones, who finds himself reluctantly mixed up in a project to bring salmon to the Highlands of the Yemen. This project changes his life and British politics forever. The book boasts a range of quirky and realistic characters, which are all affected by Fred's involvement in the Salmon project. This novel is both cleverly humorous and thought provoking, and uses a deliciously random and peculiar idea to make a point on the subject of faith and loyalty. Having said this, I found it, at moments, a little weak and transparent, though still enjoyable. Highly recommended.",0

"Judgamental, unreadable, and irritating I couldn't finish this book after trying twice. The main reasons are:<br />1. The author makes unecessary, judgamental, and discriminating comments (he deems europeans as museum goers, and would prefer to have an audience with no french men, for the sake of the rest of the audience)<br />2. The author conveys a sense of superiority. He makes irrelevant comments, for example, he mentions how he turned off a lady who wanted to speak to him in an airplane so that he could have a peaceful reading. He also mentions how he used to pay taxi drivers $100 tips only to see how they reacted. Is this related to risk or black swans? well, no.<br />3. His technical notes points to how the world misunderstoods everything that has to do with statistics or risk (except the author, of course).<br />4. Throughout the book (or the part that I tried reading) he never ever makes a statement that is straight to the point. Actually I only understood what the book is about in wikipedia.<br />5. This books is tremendously opinionated and often lacks sound referencing.<br /><br />After a couple of chapters I found this book unreadable and biased. Overall I found it so irritating that I decided to write this review.",0

"I've started so I'll finish....... This ambitious novel of over 800 pages is set in the gold rush of New Zealand in the 1860s.  The complex plot involves stolen goods, stolen identities, greed, love, murder and retribution.  The plotting is so intricate and linked to the signs of the zodiac and the astrological year – even to the extent of the chapters becoming shorter with the days…..<br /><br />It starts with a meeting of twelve men (the twelve months of the year?) and they are joined by another man, Moody (thirteen lunar months?)  I readily confess to not making head nor tail of the various charts and soon gave up trying to interpret them.  The many press reviews of the book refer to it being “dazzling”, “irresistible” and “breathtaking”.  I agree that the writing is good but the plotting is so complex it is hard to grasp and keep a track of.  I only finished this book yesterday and already I would have a problem trying to explain the plot to someone. Another problem (for me) was that the characters were all a bit of a blur and I found it hard to differentiate between them.  I had to keep reminding myself which one was Ah Souk and which Quee Long.<br /><br />I am not averse to lengthy novels and have happily read my way through War and Peace, Middlemarch and The Goldfinch but I found The Luminaries a real slog.",0

"Same Gear, Still Idling Pedestrian and disappointing. Liam made all sorts of claims about what this band were going to sound like: \\""""It's proper rock'n'roll.

He may say that the is going to record another album no matter what people say but unless Liam ups his game a lot he may have to start listening to the sound of doors closing on him.  The most disappointing album of the year. Perhaps the Deluxe Edition would be better titled the Dulux Edition, a desparate attempt to gloss over a rather ropey album",0

Just get them, and read them.<br /><br /> I've learnt so much about Greek mythology without even knowing that I was learning because I was too caught up in the racing storyline and awesome fight sequences later on in the series. The plots are fantastic and told so they are realistic and gripping. It's hilarious, I actually laugh out loud whilst reading these because Percy is so perfect. It's from his point of view and he is witty, sarcastic, sassy and completely nonchalant about all the crazy stuff that happens to him. All the characters are lovable, the gods are hilarious, the plots are exciting and it's just amazing. I would give my right arm (and my left!!) to go to Camp Half-Blood!

"Prepare to do a lot of yawning I don't understand why this book was thought to be good enough to make into a film.  I read over half of it but in the end I had to give up.  I wish I hadn't wasted so much of my life on it.  The first part when she was in Italy is okay, it is mostly telling you about what she ate.  The second part when she was in India is dire.  Page after page after page about meditation.",0
Five Stars I like this Robocop better then the old was that was made in 19s,1

"An interesting book on how climates and human folly led to societal failures A very interesting book. It shows how the over exploitation of fragile environments by modern and old societies can provoke the collapse of that very societies. It also offers some examples of successful management. The style is very enjoyable, scientific but with the gist of the story teller.",1

"Great Graphic Novel """"starter"""", It seems that this volume would work really well as a first graphic novel for a younger reader. You start with Gaiman's story and beautiful, creepy prose. As a stand alone novel, &#34;Coraline&#34; is, after all, one of Gaiman's best and most accessible works. Then you add frequent collaborator Russell's artwork. Russell does an excellent job of presenting exactly what Gaiman has written. I don't see him at the upper end of the Wow! illustrators, or at the lower end of classic-comix types. His drawing is just solid, and an honest reflection of what's going on in your head as you read the story.<br /><br /> That's why I suggest that this is a good starter. A younger reader can clearly see and follow what's going on; the art supports even if it doesn't enhance, the story; and so the whole project is very inviting. That way, if your reader likes the graphic treatment, maybe you've set her on the way to more sophisticated and experimental work like the Sandman series, or Alan Moore, or some of the even more disturbing and/or over the top illustrators.<br /><br /> So, just as Gaiman is sometimes the fantasy author for people who don't particularly like or know fantasy, this could be the graphic novel for people who dont particularly like or know graphic novels.",1

"Loses its way after a while I think this book is like marmite - you either love it or hate it.     I, like so many other reviewers, fell for the hype surrounding The Lovely Bones. At first, it is a gripping story and really pulls the reader in. My heart went out to the family who try to come to terms with the devastating loss of their child and I found myself wiping tears away as I was reading.      However, the story starts to lose its way after a few chapters and unfortunately I found it so depressing that I just could not complete it. Every page just made me feel even more bleak and I found myself avoiding the book which is a shame as I am an avid reader. As I didn't finish it, I can't comment on the end and I may be missing out on what could be a wonderful ending but for the sake of my mental health, I'll give it a miss for now!     If you choose to read this, I hope that you enjoy it but don't automatically expect it to be a 5 star read due to all the rave reviews because you may be left disappointed.",0

"Ridiculous premise I read Any Human Heart and loved it so I was really looking forward to reading more of Boyd's work. I can't emphasise enough how disappointed I was with this novel. It fails because the basic premise of the story, that Adam Kindred has, due to a number of incidents, to 'lose' himself in London, is just so far fetched. Every decision that he makes from that point onwards is equally ridiculous.<br /><br />One or two of the characters are well defined (Ingram and the ex SAS guy)and I enjoyed them but Adam himself is just an idiot and I spent most of the novel tutting and wanting to give him a good shake.  The characters from the seedier side of Boyd's London were particularly weak and I was left feeling that Mr Boyd had never crossed the path of anyone who hadn't been to public school, let alone been plucked from the criminal underclass. Some of the dialogue was actually laughable.<br /><br />Talking of social class, I think the novel would have had more chance of working if Adam had not been given such a obviously middle class background but had belonged instead to the strata of society for whom it is a constant struggle not to tip into the world that Adam found himself in. Boyd's Adam would have had far too many contacts and resources to ever find himself in a situation like the one depicted and this flaw resulted in a storyline that was unbelievable and at times ludicrous.",0

Nothing special, the rest of the Harry Potter films will never match up to its peak, The Prisoner of Azkaban.",0

wake me up when its over It must have been a real problem to keep everyone awake in the recording studio when putting this sleepy offering together. Perhaps Dido herself kept falling asleep while trying to finish it. Which all makes you think: why bother doing this at all? More Dido? No thanks.,0
hmm I've played a good few alawar games and this is probably my least favorite.. Decent graphics and not a dreadful story.. I would consider myself a seasoned adventure/hidden object/puzzle gamer..

"Beautiful but disappointing This is a beautiful book,  the pages are scalloped and wonderfully decorated. However, it comes with an insert that states, \\""""throughout this book, there are inconsistencies in the weight of flour and sugar measurements\\"""". Guidelines are given to correct the errors but to be honest I want to be able to open the page and follow the recipe. As this is not a book I would use on a daily basis, I wonder how many times I would forget to adjust the quantities, resulting in disaster! I would definitely purchase a later edition of this book if all the inconsistencies were corrected.",0

"The return of genre Fin Macleod's eight-year old son has recently been killed by a hit-and-run driver in Edinburgh, and his marriage is in a fragile state.  Only then do we learn that he is a detective, who is sent back to his childhood Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides for the first time in some twenty years to assist in what might be a copy of a murder which he had investigated in Edinburgh.  The past and the present turn out to be equally terrifying and alien. Peter May keeps them in a tense relationship by telling the story of childhood and teen years in an isolated and weather-beaten environment in the first person, and that of the police investigation in the third person.  Although slightly artificial, the device works well, and is certainly more interesting than May's use of a prologue, which is so predictable in thrillers in which past and present intersect.<br /><br />There are some compelling scenes: the annual cull of gannets on the \\""""rock\\"""" of An Sgeir out in the North Atlantic is truly awful in its combination of male rite of passage and sheer discomfort and bloodiness. And the scenes involving Marsaili, who is at the centre of a tangled complex of family and sexual relations, as is Fin, himself - almost to the point of stretching belief. Sectarian and bigoted religion and - again, predictably in detective stories - paedophilia add to the repressive and toxic mix on the island.<br /><br />Where The Blackhouse disappoints, in spite of its detailed evocation of place and extreme weather, and its sense of the past, is in the impact of the detective/thriller genre. Of course, it is supposed to be a contribution to this genre, and I chose to read it as such, but it goes successfully in other directions. As the characters of Fin and the boys, and then the men, who surround him start to grip us, and the position of Marsaili becomes almost unbearable, the easy coincidences of the genre and the coming together of Fin's first and last visit to An Sgeir to accentuate the thriller element diminish the strengths of this novel. It becomes a safe thriller. One wonders what this novel would have been like had Fin not been a detective, or at least not a function of the formula, but, instead, someone whose son had died and who was brought up against his past.  I intend to read the second of the \\""""Lewis Trilogy\\"""" to see whether Peter May does more with the character of Fin, other than set him on another investigation in the far north of Scotland.",0

"Hoping it's a grower... Having highly anticpated this album, I went out and bought it this morning. Am I disappointed? Yes. The album isn't bad, but I expected more. \\""""Stripped\\"""" was released in 2002; you'd think after 4 years \\""""Back to Basics\\"""" would be awesome. It's not; \\""""Stripped\\"""" is better. <br /> <br />Start with the positives... I love \\""""Still Dirrty\\"""" a very tongue in cheek look back at her \\""""Dirrty\\"""". Also a fan of the single \\""""Ain't No Other Man\\"""" Liking \\""""Without You\\"""" and \\""""The Right Man\\"""". <br /> <br />\\""""Thank You\\"""" a dedication to her fans is a 5 minute cringe with her fans telling her how wonderful she is, and such. It should never have seen the light of day. IMO, the 2nd disk is better than the first. Christina talks about taking inspiration from the 20s/30s/40s... Does she pull it off? No, not really. The simplicity of the music in that era was what made it great. Christina's whole powerhouse voice with ad-libs ruins that. Unfortuntely. <br /> <br />I'm hoping it'll grow on me because, if nothing else, it cost me a tenner.

"Vindication of Dylan's musical judgement If, like me, you'd find a shopping list interesting if presented with Dylan's voice and phrasing you'll like this.

"Did I switch the iron off??? \\""""Slowly terrifying\\"""" says the reviewer on the back.... the emphasis must be on the \\""""slowly\\"""". Hyped as a thriller, I was really questioning this description for the majority of the book; more the ramblings of an amnesiac with all the intensity of someone who's forgotten whether or not they've switched the iron off. The least I would expect from a thriller would be that there is something at stake - a life, a death, a nuclear war, a bowl of fruit etc. etc. But no, all the reader is given is that the main protaganist has misgivings about her past... Mmmm, cue a slow meandering trundle through her recalling things from her past, and constantly questioning the validity of this (which I found very annoying). Contrived, formulaic - I agree with one reviewer who said that ITV would quickly make a cheap 2 hour drama out of it. The last 50 pages were thrilling I'll give it that, but it fell flat for me, as it had lost my interest.",0
"missing a trick the cliffhanger at the end of season 6 was amazing, and season 7 started really well, however, i feel they missed a trick with the way the storyline has evolved and feel some storylines have been rehashed from earlier seasons. i don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen it yet. am looking forward to the rest of it though. as i obviously haven't seen the whole season yet i can't really give it more stars. loved the james marsters/ charisma carpenter episode. was great to see them again after not seeing them since buffy and angel finished. everything considered though, it is much better already than last season, which took too long to get going, and left too many things unresolved. also agree that there is not enough thumping rock tunes accompanying the action.",0

"Life by Keith Richards I was given this in book form but struggled to get through it so I thought that I would give the audio book version a go. I have to say that I can't get through this either! I'm sure that Keith Richards has had a very interesting life which I would like to hear about but, like the book, I find the audio version very hard going. I find it very strange that two people are used to read the book. I don't mind listening to Johnny Depp reading it as I can imagine that I'm listening to KR himself reading and I suspect that if he was used for the whole book I might have persevered more, but I can not get on with Joe Hurley's voice at all.

"Royally rousing Tom \\""""The Damned United\\"""" Hooper's tub-thumping biopic concerns Prince Albert, a frustrated stammerer who would become King George VI on the eve of the Second World War, following his hedonistic brother Edward's (Guy Pearce) tipple-topple from the throne.<br /><br />The script may be as sharp as a Stanley knife, but in the end, for all its tears, both joyful and sad, this is a mostly simple and predictable movie with a softness and stageyness occasionally at odds with its own sense of grandeur and the grim era it depicts. Which isn't to dismiss it as fluffy or irrelevant.<br /><br />Some critics have complained that the film comes across as royalist. But this is a decidedly personal story; that the ramifications of the events have far-reaching consequences serves to enhance the universality of the condition and the cure. In short, putting a plot in a palace is a fast-track to an exaggerated reality. The tragedy is that Bertie is a shrunken man when the country wants BIG.<br /><br />Hooper has directed a reluctant leader before, in the form of John Adams. The sense of self-doubt harboured by the Second President may have been somewhat more subtly portrayed - but then Paul Giamatti did have 500 minutes to do it. So, given the breadth of the journey, Firth's performance is masterful: the physical, externalised flip-side to A Single Man's taut, internal anguish. Rush is solid as ever as the aphoristic Lionel Logue, while Helena Bonham-Carter has a hoot as the snappy Queen Mother.<br /><br />In possibly the film's best scene, while mending a model aeroplane, Bertie speaks of his younger brother, the epileptic Johnny. My mind was flung back to Stephen Poliakoff's The Lost Prince (also featuring a gruff if slightly more avuncular Michael Gambon), which was the better, more challenging film. But Hooper's film is an enjoyable, unapologetic crowd-pleaser nonetheless.",0

"Dull, Dull and Dull. This is my set text for A-level so I feel I know it fairly well. It's such a boring book in it's essence. Austen crafts a story that could have been done in 20 chapters over 62, it seems as if she writes one clever funny and exciting chapter then decides to write three or four chapters where the chracters dance a little and play cards. If you want a book about people dancing and playing cards with a plot that could have been thought up easily try this if not and you want a real classic I suggest you try the bronte sisters perhaps hardy they are like a fine bottle of wine whilst this is more like that present you get on christmas you've been waiting for for months then are so let down by it has not aged well as it's weak social commentary shows.",0

"Good, but not great Given the hype surrounding this book, and my liking of John Green, I have to say I was a little disappointed with this book. The concept itself of two star-crossed lovers is hardly novel, and I didn't find much in this book that hadn't already been done many times before. In this way, the plot was rather boring. I cried when Dobby died in Harry Potter, I wept like a baby when Amy and Rory left in Doctor Who, but The Fault in our Stars left me feeling rather cold. I felt that Augustus and Hazel had little depth to them, and due to this I failed to connect with them as characters. They seemed, more than anything, to be canvases for Green's philosophical views to be published on, and the problem with this is that if you have disagreements with Green's views, the book feels almost preachy. To me, the passages of this book that most found profound to me either seemed obvious or fundamentally wrong. I don't mean this in an arrogant way, nor do I wish to claim that my views are in any way superior to Green's. All I'm saying is that if you've though about this stuff in the past, 'profound' passages risk no longer being profound. If your views are different to John's, passages can feel preachy (this is too harsh, but I lack a better word), or even annoying. If you've reached similar conclusions, passages can seem obvious. Another problem with canvassing Hazel and Augustus is that it makes the characters less real. Being Augustus's age, I don't deny that teenagers can think philosophically. However, the sheer volume of philosophy and wit that almost bombarded me as a reader felt artificial and prevented me from connecting with the characters. Hazel's obsession with finding out the fate of 'an imperial affliction' 's characters also annoyed me. If we're led to believe that she is this intelligent, and such a deep thinker, I just don't buy that she'd care much about the characters when, from what we hear about the book, they are almost an irrelevance in its larger meaning.<br /><br />John's writing is undoubtedly strong. Despite my previous comments, many passages in the book were effective. I was particularly stuck by Hazel's frank way of dealing with death. However, when John he tried to become too philosophical for his own good, this strong writing sometimes lost its way. John's frequent referral to the different sizes of infinity in particularly felt tacked on and unnatural to me. The dialogue similarly also sometimes felt a little lacking. I was especially not a fan of the play-like method of presenting dialogue (the whole Hazel: - Mom: - Augustus: - thing).<br /><br />I did like this book, despite the overtly negative review. It's just much easier to write negatives than positives, and I don't have the way with words that John does. Thanks for anyone who read this - I'd be interested in your opinions, as I'm sure most of you reading this will disagree with me.",0

Looking at the book as a stand alone piece it is a good enough read but it is true that being told ... Difficult to know what to say about this book overshadowed as it is by &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;  After the new copy arrived and I could read the ending properly things improved somewhat!<br /><br />Looking at the book as a stand alone piece it is a good enough read but it is true that being told to develop the characters during their childhood was the best piece of advice that was given to the author.<br /><br />Not disappointed exactly but sad at how the relationships panned out - but then life was not all sugar and spice and people are flawed so maybe the outcome was more real for that sadness,1
Unpredictable! Loved the mystery involved and the description is fantastic. It has the mystery and playfulness of a children's novel but for adult. The mystery and intrigue keeps you hooked.,1
"Avoid if you are a purist Great pop songs of course but I rated this two stars because I hate the way that some of the songs have been re-edited in order to fit on as much as possible on. For example, 'Heart Of Glass', which is faded out way too early on and is also missing the intro and 'Atomic', again missing the intro and also missing the whole of the mid-section. This 'remaster' chooses instead to repeat the 'chorus' part twice which is totally wrong. At the expense of these two most loved of Blondie tracks, we get awful remixes of 'In The Flesh' and 'Good Boys' and the pointless 'Rapture Riders'. Thankfully, most of the rest of the songs are left untouched although my only other minor complaint is the inclusion of Blondie's weakest song to date; 'Maria' slap bang in the middle of all the older 'classics' - it seems totally out of place and with the remix of 'In The Flesh', sits rather awkwardly there.    In all honestly, the only reason to get this is for the bonus DVD but get an alternative 'Best of' cd.",0

"Turgid and Tiresome I never got the Doors- to me they always sounded like a bad pub band fronted by an unbelivably pretentious narcissist.<br /><br />Morrison always struck me as one of those highly annoying individuals who believes they are brilliant at everything- One read of his poetry will show that he is not.<br /><br />I don't know I'm clearly in a minority but when I brought this album in my mid teens I was expecting to be blown away by visionary brilliance but I just found it incredibly boring and predictable.<br /><br />Furthermore like the Manic Street Preachers and The Smiths The Doors stir up such blind worship among their fans as to be nothing short of hateful.<br /><br />I've met people who firmly believe Morrison was their soulmate despite the fact they were born 20 years after he died- It's vomit inducing.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't buy the album because I'm clearly in the minority, just do so with necessary caution.",0
Moaning Minnie I've read a bunch of reviews for this book and they all go on about how great it is. I'm not sure I've read the same book because I wouldn't recommend this book at all. I didn't find the characters likeable in any way (the woman - dear GOD she was irritating and constantly constantly moaning about something). I liked the premise of the novel - take the same day year after year and see where your characters are - I guess I just didn't care where the characters were.,0

"Meh I wasn't to keen on this, it's certainly a departure from LOTR and my interest faltered at several points. It certainly doesn't follow the book in the keenest sense, adding an unnecessary plot element about being chased by Orcs or something like that!<br /><br />Cinematics, as ever, are astounding and the visuals are beautiful.<br /><br />The point where I became considerably disappointed was when they missed out the scene where Gandalf gradually introduces the Dwarves to his shape-shifting friend. In the film, they all just tumble inside in one go! Talk about a departure from the original writing!",0

Crap sound quality if you're interested in dialogue : (  apart from that...a pretty good film. This is probably quite a good film...unfortunately the audio quality was so biased towards the special effects and against the dialogue that I couldn't hear what was being said. It is infuriating...and a symptom of some hideous fashion in the film industry that imagines that no one wants to be bothered with the dialogue. The sound of the space ships exploding and whizzing around is quite wonderful...exceptional actually. But you're on a hiding for nothing if you actually want to understand what the actors are saying. It might be a symptom of the 7.1 Dolby sound used too. Anyway it's fustrating.,0

Propaganda film It was quite good. After 80 years it has lost its &#34;chilling factor&#34;. The historian giving a narration in background is a good idea. very helpful for a younger generation.,1
A nice bit of light reading Like many others I didnt realise I was ordering what is probably best classed as teenage fiction.  However as soon as I saw the print size and read chapter one I realised and as such that set my expectation that this would not be like other Grisham books.  I have to say I thought it was a fairly good book - not the most realistic plot but a nice bit of light hearted reading for an afternoon and a bit of escapism.  If this were to be one of a series I would probably get the next one.   Probably a nice intro to this sort of genre for younger readers.,0

"Exiting and beautiful A two disk CD, one with more classical music and one with techno etc. Perfect for any mood or occasion you need to put music to. A must if you loved the movie.",1
"Overall, Disappointing One of the reasons this film is disappointing is that when you look at the talent behind the making of it you have every right to have high hopes of an excellent film.  Bryan Singer directing, Christopher McQuarie writing, the team that brought us The Usual Suspects, and in front of the camera there is Ewen McGregor, Stanley Tucci and Ian McShane, all very good actors each of them capable of so much.  So what's gone wrong?  Well the film comes across as a mix of The Princess Bride and King Kong, but it lacks both the wit and magic of both those films.  Firstly the two leads as Jack and the princess lack any real character they come across as slightly dull and boring, especially Jack.  It's hard to truly root for them.  Added to that Stanley Tucci and Ewen Bremner, as his evil side kick, are meant to be both evil and comical, but I'm afraid neither of them are funny and only Tucci manages to come close to being evil.  Lastly the action sequences often fail to give any real sense of tension or even excitement on occasions.  Any positives?  Well of course the special effects are very convincing, with the giants looking very realistic and, unlike the comic relief from the humans, at times are quite funny.  A couple of the action sequences do offer up the tension and excitement that are missing in the others but that just adds to the overall disappointment as it gives a greater sense of what could have been.  Of course my 7 and 8 year old boys loved it but for the adults thinking of watching this, try not to get your hopes up too high, then you won't be too disappointed.",0

"Superb electric folk music I had already had the album 'Babel' when I found out that 'Sigh No More' was their debut album.I just  'loved' Babel and just to get their debut album. I must admit at first, i was not impressed, but the more I listen to it, it grows on you and now I listen to it more than i do Babel. For those into 'electric folk', these 2 albums are a must for the listener- they are brilliant / superb. ( if you are into electric folk type of music). Can I just say that Babel is always on my car CD, and Sigh No More is on my computer CD.",1
"Eye wateringly awful I really, really, really dislike pedants but watching this film has made me one. Why was it made? The first Bridget Jones was a likeable person, in the sequel she is just whinging, annoying and needs to be told to grow up.    I disliked the whole film but these are the real low points    1) The landing in the pig pen that just happened to be in the middle of a field. Slapstick at it's worse    2) The trip to the hairdresser where she turns round in the chair and sees her hair for the first time. Who has EVER gone to the hairdresser and had their hair cut with their back to the mirror?    3)The scene in the chemist where she is miming pregnancy. You go into a chemist, pick up a packet of Clearblue, pay and leave. Simple    4)Standing up at the quiz to deliver the wrong answer - why did she stand up?     5) The lesbian character who falls in love with her - where did that come from and why was it necessary    6) Thailand - yep, all you find there is drugs and ladyboys - nothing else - just those two things. The whole country is just awash with those two things    7) The Thai jail, singing Madonna and her whole life being put into perspective by one line from a fellow inmate    8) The part where Colin Firth's character puts his office phone on speaker so she can deliver her 'saucy message'. If the visitors in his office were so important why would he even pick up the phone, never mind put it on speaker phone!    The point I am making is, if a joke has to be sledgehammered into a situation, then it is best to leave it out. This was a painful, painful film to watch. Also, what happened to Rene Zelweggar? She looked dreadful from start to finish..............",0

"Good piece of music but... As most of metalheads I was waiting for this album as child for Xmas.   To be honest I was quite excited as I really enjoyed the 'Locust' single. Even if I prefer MH from 'Blackening' than 'The Burning Red' still I was overwhelmed by this single - there's so much happening in this song.  As for the whole album I am a bit dissapointed but only a bit.  Don't get me wrong, it is still very good MH's album but still I think 'Blackening' or 'The Ashes of Empires' are definetely better than latest recording from Rob and his mates.  My favourites tracks are Locust and Who we Are and... that's it. I fancy the rest but I can't get to attracted to them.   My final summary would be - that's a very good and robust album, it is not a waste of your money if you buy it. Still, for me, it isn't as good as few previous albums. So I rate the album on 4 stars.  However the fan pack edition is highly overrated by all means. It's just one of the magazines plus album plus bottle opener and huge poster. One star less for it.",0

I have to agree with most of the comments from all the reviewers here with particular reference to \\""""Shooting Star\\"""" and \\""""Feel Like Makin' Love\\"""".<br /><br />(Incidentally does anyone remember in the days before computers when Radio One DJ Johnnie Walker put together a spliced tape of the little guitar break in the middle of \\""""Feel Like Makin' Love\\"""" to a solo that was about 3 or 4 times its original length?)<br /><br />Where I do differ however, is that I believe Simon Kirke's two compositions \\""""Anna\\"""" and \\""""Weep No More\\"""" are more than 'album fillers'. I'm not sure the latter benefits from the string section but, I'd be happy to have written them.<br /><br />Bad Company had the potential of being a great band (and although they became big stadium fillers) I'm not convinced they fulfilled their collective potential.",0

"A fresh perspective. Like most of the other reviewers on here, I could just make a lengthy list of the film's inaccuracies - the historical and ethnical to name but a few.<br /><br />Far be it for anyone to say that they \\""""enjoyed\\"""" this film. No one \\""""enjoys\\"""" a film about the Holocaust. But I honestly did appreciate it.<br />Watching from a child's perspective, if not entirely accurate, is fresh, and their sheer innocence moved me to tears; Bruno's naivety only heightened this.<br />And while some have criticised the use of English actors, the familiarity, for me, made it all the more real and moving.<br /><br />I won't go into historical inaccuracy, because if you know your history, the title and cover will tell you more than enough. Personally, I think the idea of writing / showing the Holocaust through the eyes of a child is inspired.<br /><br />Don't knock it until you've tried it. The ending alone will stir you in so many ways, James Horner's compositions are beautiful and the acting is genuinely very good.<br /><br />Schindler's List it definitely is not.

"Could 'a Been a Contender! 'Starless and Bible Black' followed what I consider to be arguably King Crimson's best work, 'Larks Tongues in Aspic', and like 1971's 'Lizard' it's one of those albums that comes close to being great, but never quite gets there.<br />On the plus side, this record is one of Crimson's rockiest albums and opening track, the entertaining 'The Great Deceiver' is a good slice of meaty, balls out rock that gets things off to a corking start.<br />'The Night Watch', like 'Book of Saturday' and 'Exiles' from 'Larks Tongues...' shows the band having a good ear for a decent melody and a well-written song. 'Trio' is a dreamy, meditative, mellotron soaked track that sweeps you away.<br />The rest of the album is a bit hit and miss for me. 'Lament' begins well enough, but loses focus, as does 'The Mincer'. The instrumental tracks are ok, but never seem to get anywhere. There isn't a good enough payoff, particularly with the title track, to justify the intensity and sonic assault of the 'journey', so to speak. That track needs a 'come down', similar to that of the title track from Pink Floyd's 'Saucerful of Secrets' to really round it off and close the album properly.<br />I like the fact that the songs have a 'live in the studio' sound as it gives the record a unique quality, but a lot of the songs end quite abruptly and sound like they needed a little bit more work in the writing process. Other people will feel that this is intentional, but it's something I find irritating.<br />As for the individual performances, the nucleus of Fripp, John Wetton and Bill Bruford was coming along nicely by this stage and each member offers something a bit different, whilst maintaining an overall high level of musicianship.<br />I suppose the problem with 'Starless and Bible Black' is that it's sandwiched between two of the best King Crimson albums in the entire back catalogue; 'Larks Tongues in Aspic' and the next album, 'Red', which would see the band signing off in some style. Taken on it'sown, 'Starless...' is a solid enough entry, but doesn't quite hit the sweet spot for me.",0

I have to say as a fan of Iron Maiden, this album is fantastic, It is quite different to the early work of Iron Maiden but still kicks ass, The lyrical themes are once again interesting, from one song being about travelling through space and another about an impending doom (Possibly something like a nuclear war) Overall I would say my favourite track on this album is When the wild wind blows and my least being El-Dorado, but this is obviously just my opinion, I would recommend this album to any Rock or Heavy Metal fan.",1

"my inner goddess needs a good kicking Apparently based on The Twilight novels, Fifty Shades of Grey makes Stephanie Meyer's efforts look like Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />Most people are familiar with the plot by now, 21 year old girl meets a millionaire businessman and gets involved in a dominant/submissive relationship with him.<br /><br />Having to listen to the internal dialogue of the main character was excruciating, if I had to listen to her bleat on about her \\""""inner goddess\\"""" for any longer I would have beat myself just for a distraction from the pain of reading this drivel (she mentions said inner goddess about 50 times)<br /><br />Strangely, even thought the character is able to have an orgasm if she so much as encounters a stiff breeze, is able to attract the attentions of a billionaire businessman etc the most unbelievable thing is that the reader is supposed to believe that a 21 year old English Literature student does not own a computer or use the internet.",0

"It started so well, but was ultimately disappointing This was my first Neil Gaiman novel (although I had seen the film Stardust without realising who the author was), and I do think he writes very well.  The plot and the characters began so promisingly, but by the end I was left feeling mildly dissatisfied.  The themes could have been expanded and enriched - the central concept is such an original idea - but somehow the drive and passion seemed to go out of the narrative about two thirds of the way through.  I'd love to have seen Stephen King have a crack at this in his heyday.",0

"not groundbreaking it seems like the \\""""double album\\"""" trend is starting to wear out thin...and the Foo Fighters are still hoping that we fall for it. When Smashing Pumpkins released their double set, people were astounded. The truth of the matter is double albums are also a facade to hide bad production...I mean if we actually calculate the worthwhile songs on this double set one would really be surprised to find out that only 20% of the material can make an OK album...but it is interesting to see people fall for it. I have listened to both sides and it is obvious that Foo Fighters are trying to appeal to the rock scene by doing a raw side and an \\""""unplugged\\"""" side...however don't be fooled there is nothing fantastic about it. Ther first side is very tiresome. All songs sound the same and Dave's vocals gets annoying. The second side seems to be more of a collection of songs evidently inspired by Nirvana's style (one song sounds very much like \\""""Something In the way\\"""") and Pearl Jam's country \\""""No Code\\"""" (there is a strong reminiscence of \\""""Off he Goes\\"""" in a lot of these songs). That doesn't make it more interesting than the first side. Either way, the band is trying too hard to accommodate to people's tastes and it feels unnatural, overdone and lame. The beginning of \\""""in Your Honour\\"""" is great but after I loose interest in Dave's music very quickly. In comparison, I find \\""""One By One\\"""" more punchy, \\""""The Colour and the Shape\\"""" more developed, and \\""""There is Nothing Left To Lose\\"""" more melodic. Now it's up to you. See it for yourself but please... stay real!",0

"Disappointingly average **WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />It has been a long time since I read a crime novel. As well as having a background in criminology, I found myself jaded by the likes of CSI and then just outright put off the genre by Patricia Cornwell.<br /><br />However, when my wife said that this was the best Rebus book that she'd read to date (and she's read all of them), I thought I'd give it ago.<br /><br />In terms of plot, a number of women have gone missing from the A9 over the years and John Rebus (now retired from the Police Service, but trying to find a way back in) is a civilian in The Cold Case Unit where he is handed a possible link to all of them, including an active case of a Missing Person who disappeared only a few weeks prior.<br /><br />Bad things:<br />- the first 80 pages centre solely on Rebus. He interacts with other characters, but you get not real sense of their persona or off-page events. It is a very narrow focus, and I wanted to know more of what was going with some of the other players.<br /><br />- Rebus is a quasi-machiavellian character. He cuts corners to get the job done, including fraternising with criminals and lying to his colleagues. He's not a villain per se... but he right on border. Now this is not a bad thing, and some of his more sociopathic scenes (ie; when he answers Clarke's phone and then NEVER gives her the message) are quite good. My problem is this: his colleagues know that he is a lying, manipulative, generally speaking a dinosaur of a Police Officer... and not only do they still let him in (when they don't have to), but they also go along with him, knowingly allowing themselves to be played. I know a few serving officers, and there is no way they would stand for that behaviour, especially from a civilian.<br /><br />- The ending. There is no two ways about this - it is awful. I don't what happened. Maybe the author was running over his word count, or the publishers edited it into the disappointing mess it became. But Iwas so very disappointed, and for two reasons.<br /><br />1 - The villain is identified, and for a hundred or so pages is defiant and denies the case built against him - and that was very good. And then, over two or three pages, he dissolves into a quivering mess who confesses everything... because a spotty teenager physically threatens him. This is an individual who has murdered 5 people and gone to great lengths to conceal their bodies and clean up after himself - and generally speaking is as hard as nails - and when a boy intimidates him, he folds? Nope, I'm not buying it.<br /><br />2 - We never understand the driving forces behind the criminal mind. We are never offered even a shred of a reason behind the psychopathic nature, or why he left the calling card he did. Instead, Rebus just says: \\""""I don't think he even knows himself.\\""""<br />I found this incredibly frustrating, and then they crowbarred the book title into the closing lines and the whole sorry mess jarred.<br /><br />Now, with all of the above in mind, there are many redeeming features of this book.<br /><br />- There is some great use of conflict. From the start, we are presented with Missing Persons, Rebus' desire to get back into the Police Service, his dislike of authority, the politics of career officers, the shadow of The Complaints dept. Lots of conflict, lots of little quests going on - really good stuff that when woven together give rise to a believable world.<br /><br />- There are some great twists and plot developments. My favourite was the the Missing Person who was not a Missing Person... although I was disappointed in such an obvious reason given for her running away.<br /><br />- the display of Rebus being an outmoded dinosaur was great. I loved the analogy to him being vinyl in a digital age (he cannot get a handle on smartphones or twitter)... but yet, like vinyl, remains popular and even contemplates a comeback.<br /><br />- Some people have criticised the overuse of the A9. Personally, I think this is unfair, and I enjoyed the sense of this concrete river feeding the most rural parts of a wild country, and the descriptions of the cars alternately as workhorses and warhorses presented a good counterpoint to the rural life that they visited.<br /><br />So, in the end, 3/5. Not the worst book ever written, but I felt it could have been so much more.<br />I guess the acid test is this: Will I read more of Rankin's work? Yes, I probably will... but I'm going to give him a break for a few months.",0

"The closest thing to a masterpiece Kansas ever brought out. I love this album, it's one of my favourites from the west coast era in the seventies. This album has a sentimental value to me, and I find the composition on some of the songs is fantastic, from a personal point of view. However, I will say that this album may not be for everyone. Most of my friends who have listened to this album haven't been keen on it. But, if you like Prog I think that there's a fighting chance that this album may appeal to you.",1

"Coraline 3d Bought this to add to our collection of 3d Blue ray discs (having been blown away by the quality of the 3D repoduction of previous discs - 'The Hole, Sanctum and Captain America). I was also intrigued by the offer of free galsses. I perhaps should have known something was amiss given the low price but other reviews had waxed lyrical about the quality of the 3D. What I got was a disc that produces its 3D effect using the old fashioned green/red lenses. As such colours were almost absent and the 3D effect was abysmal by comparison with the other aforementioned productions. I ended up watching the 2D disc using the TV's built in 3D effect. Be warned.",0

"Some enjoyable chapters, patronising tone of writing Bought this for a trip away as it generally had a high rating. The first part of the book was reasonably enjoyable as she talks about a time she wasn't confident and didn't know much about herself or 'being a woman' which makes her much more likeable an funny. There WERE some bits I literally laughed out loud at, but when she grew up in the book her patronising tone did, also.    She is patronising, contradictory and arrogant in some parts. Making vast generalisations that don't really do anything for feminism. She talks about being a feminist whilst making more problems than we ought to deal with by suggesting we think about what men are saying and assess whether it's a misogynist comment or not.    Nice book, but not all that gripping and parts which did get my back up a little bit. Easy to dip in and out of.",0

"28 Days Later rip off You can't judge a movie's quality by its box-office take. Then again, you can't judge it by the hype and shameless plugging that precedes it either: It seems that if studios spend enough on advertising, marketing and other sneaky techniques, even the most terrible cinematic rubbish can be foisted onto the public consciousness as a \\""""much-anticipated event.\\"""" But every so often, the media blitz backfires, the loud advance trumpeting ends in a barely audible squawk, and an overhyped movie simply fizzles and is instantly forgotten.<br /><br />This 28 Days Later rip-off from the untalented director of 'Constantine' (Keanu Reeves) is littered with plot holes and inconsistencies. Luckily, for the filmmakers at least, Smith's charisma is strong enough that you store these irregularities in the back of your mind. They don't resurface until you are away from the cinema, thinking about the movie or discussing it with others.<br /><br />The first hour of the film is by far its strongest. It plays like a cross between 28 Days Later and One Man and His Dog. Smith, in a performance of stamina and subtlety that recalls that of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, wanders around an island that has become a wilderness. There's something childlike and silly in the way that he re-populates the city in his imagination, decking out his local video store with mannequins whom he hails and chats to as if they were old buddies and nothing had happened recently. This is when teh movie becomes silly.<br /><br />And then, perhaps inevitably, the film goes to hell. The Infected become increasingly visible and what a non-fright they are: at best, hairless fast-moving creatures; at worst, like figures from some techno video a decade ago. The increasingly zombified picture also gets more cloyingly theological (a Brazilian woman, played by City of God's Alice Braga, and her child appear as if from nowhere), crashingly literal (\\""""This is ground zero! This is my site!\\"""" he yells), and plain icky (riffs on how Bob Marley is a musical virologist whose rhythms and lyrics might heal humanity).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the film is littered with scenes that make no sense. We see Neville sprinkling liquid outside his house, presumably the concentrated garlic of the book, although we're not told this. Elsewhere he's shown curled up to sleep in his bath (eh?) and then waking up in his bed. You may also wonder why he chose to hole up in a terraced house that Van Helsing couldn't even hope to defend.<br /><br />What started out so promisingly, a companion piece of sorts to Children of Men, disappears in a frenzy of screaming, head-banging, bloodiness - followed by an unconvincing redemption. I Am Legend is a disappointment, but one that cannot be laid at Smith's feet. He works very hard and gives a strong performance. Unfortunately, those creative minds responsible for making sure he had a coherent and plausible story to work with let him down.l virologist whose rhythms and lyrics might heal humanity).

"The idea is simple - it's the jigsaw structure that makes or breaks this story Three stars is a bit of a sitting-on-the-fence rating, but even after watching the film twice, I'm still unsure, so I wanted to give it the benefit of my doubts.<br /><br />In essence, and at the risk of writing a spoiler (would that be possible???), the basic story is VERY simple ... 6 characters (or maybe souls) live their lives in different locations and times and make various decisions which have specific repercussions which ripple and echo long after death. This combination of lives/actions/responses continue to be \\""""...replayed throughout eternity...\\"""".<br /><br />This not dissimilar in some ways to the Hindu concept of samsara: (an unbroken chain and cycle of births and deaths).<br /><br />Amongst others, themes of love, hate, trust, broken trust, loyalty and disloyalty, freedom and oppression emerge very quickly and continue throughout.<br /><br />None of that is really a spoiler because you work that much out for yourself very quickly once you become accustomed to the fractured, spasmodic and often frantic non-linear intercutting of the stories.<br /><br />And therein lies my main uncertainty about this film.<br /><br />Was the chosen approach to storytelling actually necessary? The same basic structure lay at the heart of Joseph Heller's book 'Catch 22'. When I was a student I spent 18 months tightly analysing the chronology of that story to see if everything actually worked once you reassembled 'the jigsaw'. Heller's use of this 'fracturing' technique was central to the heart and soul of his story - but I'm not at all sure that the same applies to 'Cloud Atlas', even though hearts and souls really are central to David Mitchell's storyline.<br /><br />Could the stories have been told in a more linear fashion and would that have been as effective? Again, I'm not sure, but I suspect that in time it will be felt that the continuous use of eye-popping jump-cuts between characters/souls, time periods, locations, events and storylines was just too extreme and unnecessary. There's no doubt that the film is visually stunning, but that alone is never enough if the visuals are little more than a veil stretched across emptiness.<br /><br />Two other points worry me -<br /><br />(1) One thing makes me suspect that at it's heart there is really little more than opportunism: that's the idea of 'the cloud'. Did Mitchell think to himself, \\""""Everyone's talking about storing data in 'the cloud', so how about fusing that idea with where souls might be uploaded, stored, and then downloaded back into a new body?\\""""<br /><br />Is that clever or just shallow exploitation?<br /><br />(2) If you download the full script of the film (freely available if you search for it), you will find that some of the dialogue for the crucial end-scenes is missing. I'm thinking here of the 'womb to the tomb', 'birthing our future' and 'death is only a door' comments made by Sonmi-451 at the end of her final interrogation. Were they added because even the directors realised that the tangled webs they had woven to try to deceive us(*) had, in fact, become just too tangled and needed straightening out with a bit of good old-fashioned exposition?<br /><br />On the other hand - the chance to see Hugh Grant as a blood-crazed, throat-slitting, psychotic, skull-faced barbarian is almost worth the price of purchase on its own ----- almost.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />(*) Credit to Sir Walter Scott for the original words which I have paraphrased.cessary.

"A waste of my time to spare yours. Truely awful. Sean Bean obviously was more interested in the paycheck to bother reading the script. The cop in this mess looks like a young version of the bird off Police Acadamy and acts no better. The storyline is confused to say the least and you really dont care what happens to any of them. The gouls are more odd than scary. The music lifted from the game is the only good thing. Rule number one in film-making; do not base them on computer games!

How could that be? It was nice that all the original actors returned, and the way they brought these characters back was really ingenious and befitting the series. The problem with this movie for me is that they bring in lots of great ideas but do far too little with it to do it any justice. They seem to be running through the plot having no time for anything except the action sequences. That actually meant that I was not very engaged with the story. In fact, the action sequences were rather disappointing as well. It could be described as boring at times as there was just too much repetition. Sad to have wasted money on this.",0

"A bewildering, frustrating execution There is a reason why this film bombed in America. It sucks. It's pretentious, baffling, and teeth-gratingly obnoxious, a little like the game XIII which, although has an amazing writing and direction is a mediocre shooter at best and bombed, so no sequel was ever made even though there was one intended and left on a frustrating cliffhanger. But I digress.  The characters are unlikeable, Michael Cera is the worst of them all. I understand now why there is a viral hit of a video of Cera getting hit in the face in this film, because this film's so damn maddening! Everything goes so fast in this film and visually in this film it is impressive, making me emit a \\""""Woah.\\"""" in a low voice.  This soon turned to inward screamings of \\""""For God's sake!\\"""" at the irritating and repetitive nature of this film.  The question I want to first ask - Who is it aimed at? People over 30 won't get it. People under 30 won't get it. Geeks won't get it. What is the film supposed to be? When has it ever being cool to insert a lot of bewildering text shots that add nothing to the storyline, what little there is of it? Is it meant to be a comedy? A romance film? A combination of both? No, it's about a socially awkward teenager that is struggling to decide who to sleep with.   ...   Yeah, you get the idea. It's as cliched to the high hills. Now for sake of argument I haven't read the comic books, and I hope to God they were much better than this travesty. The main problem with this film is it tries to market itself to way too many people with too many video game references to be funny. It isn't funny. Barely even smile lifting. It's hardly a wink to the audience, but you either get the references or you don't.  That brings me onto my next point. Edgar Wright has proven to be an excellent director, his direction on Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were very good. But this? Well, considering he co-wrote the idea I can imagine he will have to beg the producers to allow him to make a film again.",0

"Struggled through to the conclusion I bought this book hoping to read it before the TV adaptation, but having finished it decided not to bother with the TV series. Half way through this book I wondered why I was bothering, the characters did not engage me and the plot line was feeble. It took me a lot longer to read than most books because the majority of it was quite simply boring although the prose flows well enough. I kept reading on hoping that it would all come together and something would happen. In the event it did come together in a great rush at the end but even the conclusion left me thinking the whole thing was contrived.",0
"A unique and moving historical novel An absorbing and original novel, I can't think that I've read anything with similar themes or plot lines before. A wonderful mix of my favourites genres: historical fiction, family drama and thriller.<br /><br />The characters all developed throughout the novel, as they should: Nella grew from a naive, self-centred girl into a resourceful young woman, and the character of Marin was fascinatingly complex. There were at least three twists that I didn't see coming, and the final quarter of the novel was incredibly moving, a mix of tragedy and emerging hope.<br /><br />I do have three criticisms of the book though, 1) that it was written in the present tense, which I find quite distracting and it doesn't flow as well as past tense, 2) some of the sentences were a little overwritten and didn't always make sense (but it wasn't very often and much of the phrasing was beautiful, so I can overlook it!), and 3) I wanted to know more about the miniaturist, her background and her motivations, but there wasn't much explanation or resolution there. It wasn't made clear exactly how she knew that the events were going to happen in advance: was the implication that she really did have some kind of psychic gift, or was she just good at observing people? Or was Nella's mind reading too much into the figures she sent?",1

"Interesting, but somewhat repetitive The paradox of choice is certainly a book which is worth reading. However, before I was even halfway through it, I honestly started to get somewhat bored with it since it is in fact quite repetitive.<br /><br />In short, the author discusses the other side of the coin with regards to choices.<br />Having multiple choices at any given time is most often viewed as something which is desirable. An example of this, is the fact that the older generations typically point out how fortunate the younger generations are for having so many opportunities in life and so many possible choices at their disposal. But is our current level of happiness actually proportionate to the number of choices we have available? This is one of the key areas of discussion in this book.<br /><br />The author's intention is to point out that the many obvious benefits of having multiple choices come with a somewhat less obvious set of detrimates. These detrimates are then discussed in detail throughout the book which ends with a section of suggestions on how we are to cope with the overwhelm and negative effects of the many choices we are faced with on a day to day basis.<br /><br />The good thing about the somewhat repetitive nature of this book is that it actually helps solidify the key points. It should also be mentioned that the book seems to be repetitive because the author is essentially discussing somewhat identical points within various areas. So in all fairness, I am not implying that the fact that this book feels somewhat repetitive is solely a bad thing.<br /><br />The paradox of choice will certainly offer the reader some food for thought.",0

"Another Money Maker for Westlife Westlife are okay, but go to their concerts and you are fleeced (they are not alone I know) with  exorbitant prices charged for programmes and other  merchandise. This is another 'greatest hits' album released after they announced their demise and therefore guaranteed to reap the benefits for them and their producer(s). They have already released a 'greatest hits' album and this is little different. They are a money making machine, but I thought they might have given heir fans something back at the end but no, they have simply re-issued, almost intact, a previous incarnation. This is a review from a parent of a teenage girl who idolised Westlife, but even she is beginning to realise that this mediocre band have provided the musical world with nothing of note, whilst unashamedly making vast profits.",0

"SHM Import fallling short this time... I received this yesterday, and I have to be honest this is a criticism of the label and Amazon more than anything... but I received this yesterday and I was confused as the Import only has 10 tracks listed (as opposed to the 22 the UK version has) and the CD comes in at a measly 46 mins (as opposed to the 79 mins of the UK Version). The tunes themselves are faultless but this is about the product. For a product that is nearly 30 mins shorter than the UK Version and costing more this is actually appalling... I have even messaged Steve Angello to ask what's going on and he's informed me to his knowledge there should be no difference in the track listing. However I assure you there is!! He is looking into this as far as I know. My recommendation is to purchase the UK version of this CD not this. And I'm appalled at Amazon for not being more clear on the tracklisting prior to release. And if anyone is wondering why I didn't just buy the UK Version, I had pre-ordered this version as at the time there were no others showing on Amazon and I thought there would be no difference in track listing (as usually if there is it's only slight) and didn't check back until I had received it yesterday (not a mistake I will be repeating...). Be advised...",0

"it looks like I am going to have settle for giving her ... This item was listed as new.  For £14 I expected a brand new product.  The box had no polythene cover and the case is covered in scratches.  Not one or two.  I've counted 7 large scratches which are in cases 3-4 cm's long and 2mm's wide.  I purchased this as a gift for my Mum's birthday.  Amazon has advised that if I want a refund, I need to send it back.  When I selected the return, or replace option on the Amazon site, the only option available to me is a refund.  This requires the item to be returned.  This makes no sense seeing that Amazon are currently listing 9 available in stock.

"I had to turn it off in the end I have not watched the entire DVD ,as I could not stand it , any longe.Of course it is good , but it is not anything near like how good they had been in the seventies.Of course age to the members of the band has to be taken into account.The biggest crime of the show has to be Jason Bonhams drums sound.This issue was addressed in the Unledded project , the drummer sounded and played like Bonzo.One of Bonzos main attributes was his bass pedal playing , and the fact you could hear what he was playing.Bonzo often employed simple recording techniques to get the sound out of the kit.Those recording and sound techniques seem to have been long forgotten.There are some lovely bass pedal techniques played on the original tracks \\""""scince I have been loving you\\"""", that on this disc ,Jason cannot appear to play , and well anyway the bass pedal parts , cannot be really heard .Jason plays the very simple but powerfull single stroke drum rolls on trampled underfoot ,, but is totally lost in the mix.Those simple rolls were so powerfull and important on the origional track, John new that.Jason frequently swings out of time and also does not have the economic sense his father had , and knowing when not to play.Jason leave that annoying self timing hi hat technique alone please.Page at times is all over the place but hey he always was.I guess people may not agree with me, however I have listened to Zep and saw them in the seventies, and I will stick to the origionals , including live recordings.I may be the first person to be glad I was not there.",0

"Comedown Machine - Is this is? probably not but that's OK This album is more of one for the fans, the band proving to them that they still have their creative spark.<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me if this was just a taste of a new Strokes era that is emerging, one that isn't bond to sounding like that 2001 debut 'is this it'.<br /><br />It's not a bad attempt... I wouldn't say any Strokes album is particularly bad, although i would say that it has been easier to tune out their most recent stuff a lot easier that the hard hitting songs of old.<br /><br />Anyway i'm gonna name and shame the tracks that i like / dislike so you can skip through the dross.<br /><br />1. Tap Out - this is clearly the best track on the album. very 80's influenced, which i love. It's very listenable and i really like the lyrics to this song. I think it's about meeting someone and having a instant connection, then realising that it wasn't real, only to give into temptation and do it all again the next night. Fantastic. 5/5<br /><br />3. One way Trigger - the cheap key board effect gets a little grating after a bit and i dislike the high pitched wailings of julian Casablanca's on this particular track. It seems to drag on too long for my liking. The best Stroke songs are short and punchy with catchy hooks and cool lyrics. This unfortunately lacks any of these qualities 2/5<br /><br />4. Partners in Crime. I like this track, it's interesting and different to a lot of the rest of the album. Love the guitar solo at the end if you can get past the weird guitar noises at the beginning, takes a few listens but i think it's one of the stronger and more uplifting tracks on the album. 3.5/5<br /><br />5. Chances - so 80's. reminds me of Ultravox, they must of been listening to them when they recorded this. however i do like it and think it's one of the most listenable tracks on the albums and shows the variety of sounds the band is capable of producing. However the lyrics are quite sad, and self deprecating, which leaves you with a bit of a depressing after taste. 4/5<br /><br />6. Happy ending - OK. reminds me a lot of some of their previous albums. good but not great... a lot of catchy guitar riffs and generally quite an upbeat and good way to finish off the album. Ending on a high.<br /><br />7. Call it fate, Call it Karma  - Pointless track. Not even sure why they put this one hear. Maybe because they wanted to have something different on the end, to emphasis that this album is different from the rest... But really comes across as quite strange and self indulgent. 1/5<br /><br />Overall, it's a bit of a mixed up album. I don't know if they meant it to be that way, but it seems like it was intentional to show the full spectrum of The Strokes talents. However there are too many up's and down's for my liking. It is too inconsistent to be their best record, but i think it knows that and isn't trying to compete with their debut. It serves as more of a outlet for the band to rediscover their sound and evolve their music in a less obvious but more artistic direction.",0
"Dissapointed I was very disappointed with this book.  Having enjoyed Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I was looking forward to reading The Lost Symbol as I like the historical element in Dan Brown’s books.  Unfortunately for me this was completely lacking in The Lost Symbol as the location of Washington did nothing for me.  I found it hard to get excited about the “history” of the city.  Although the buildings are obviously spectacular it was difficult to find history in something 200 years old!  Perhaps it is just because I am fortunate to live in a country surrounded with history that I struggled with what Dan Brown was trying to do with this book.  To me the stunning architecture and ancient history of Rome and Paris was a real draw in the first two books.<br /><br />I have also never had an interest in the Masons but I was happy to learn, yet again this just did not grab me.  I did enjoy the parts describing Noetics and found the detail fascinating, but unfortunately for me this was not enough to keep me enthralled.<br />I thought the book started well but to me the story just became a bit too far fetched and to be honest I started not to care about the characters.  A shame.",0
"Before I go to sleep - kept me awake! This book kept me reading at quite a pace, but by the end there were lots of questions I felt were unanswered to my satisfaction, and the ending was confusing and a bit neat. Full marks to the author though for keeping the threads of a troubled mind going.",0

Skyfall my foot! Service and delivery were excellent but the film....What a disappointment.  Started well (for about 15 minutes) and then went down the pan. Will not disclose the ridiculous plot but why quite well known actors would want to appear in this rubbish baffles me (they must have been paid very well).

"The book is great, so the DVD can't fail ? I've read Gruffalo/'s Child to my kids for bedtime forever.    The original 'Gruffalo' story is short, so the DVD, as it's priced, has to stretch the story longer; sometime with unnecessary tension building.  I'd rather that the DVD creators included the 'Gruffalo's Child' or any of the other Julia Donaldson stories into the same DVD.  Otherwise the animation is great and true to the original books, just in 3D figures!",0

"Appraisal A very good novel, a very humane King a really moving novel much different to the King I know. I enjoyed it",1
"Nothing original - not bad though!. The first (and my least favourite) of 3 action movies that see the missions undertaken by a group of mercenaries led by Barney Ross (Stallone - who also directs), they're called in by a CIA 'front man' Church (a cameo appearance by Bruce Willis) to overthrow a dictator (David Zayas) and a renegade CIA operative, James Munroe (Eric Roberts) and their 'private army' on an island called &#34;Vilena&#34;.<br /><br />Expect little in the way of plot (overused/tweaked in so many films), but average action scenes - car chases, explosions and not much else. At least the assembly of action movie stars like : Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Jason Statham and Arnold Schwarzenegger etc are given something to do.<br /><br />If it means anything, without this, there wouldn't be two (far better) sequels - reportedly, a fourth movie is in the works, if it happens, that's where 'EX&#34; should stop.<br /><br />A case where the sequels certainly outdo the original!.",0

Perfect Perfect,1
"Overrated Quite simply an overrated, and very boring read. As another reviewer pointed out, this book is a memoir rather than a \\""""how to\\"""" book - and a dull memoir at that.<br /><br />I think most of the positive reviews here might be written by followers of the author's online blog - which is fine, but I think it has caused this book to become highly overrated. I wanted to help balance the reviews for the sake of those people out there that were looking for good memory books.<br /><br />For much better books on memory I would suggest:<br /><br />The Art Of Memory Frances A Yates (If you are interested in the history of the art)<br /><br />or<br /><br />How to Develop a Perfect Memory by Dominic O'Brien  (If you are interested in a \\""""how to\\"""" book)<br /><br />This is just my opinion, but I think you might find far more interesting things in the above two books, especially if you're new to the \\""""art of memory\\"""".",0

"A good album but not what I was expecting Now I've been a fan of TDG for several years now and I would rate them as my favorite band. As soon as Transit of Venus was annouced I was so hyped for its release and really looking forward to listening to what they have to offer with this album.<br /><br />After listening to Transit of venus for the past few months I can say that its a decent album with a slightly different direction to their previous ablums and because of this it comes just short of my original expectations. This \\""""new\\"""" type of music for TDG isn't exactly a bad thing its just not really what I had come to love. The passion and feel of their past work doesn't really seem to make an appearance in this album. One could argue that some of the past albums (One-X in particular with X-Lead Singer Adam Gontier issues) had heavy influences from situations that were occuring from real life experiences, enhancing the feel of the album/s. And perhaps this album lacks that \\""""drive\\""""? I wouldn't say that an album needs personal stuggle to make it good but you can tell a person deeply cares about their music even more so than normal when they're going through and coming out the other side of a bad situation.<br /><br />Anyway, for me the album didn't really have a heavy hitting memorable song within it. Songs like \\""""Never Too Late\\"""", \\""""One\\"""" and \\""""I Hate Everything About You\\"""" really stick in my mind and are fairly concrete in my top songs list. Nothing really stood out in Transit of Venus most of the song were good but plain with a couple of fairly lacking ones within it. If I had to pick a favorite song it would most likely be \\""""Anonymous\\"""" as it has a aspects of the TDG I loved.<br /><br />Anyone who has listened to TDG's old albums will hopefully see where this is coming from. All in all if you are open to different types of music and enjoyed their previous work then sure go for this album! I did enjoy the album, its just I wanted more than it offered.",0

I feel that this is carte blanche for men to feel that they can inflict pain in any shape or form on any female, because really, women do want men to behave like this. Young women reading this book will feel that \\""""oh yes, he says he loves me\\"""" and I can put up with him and his strange quirks, so long as he is mine.  I consider this book to be dangerous literature - a feeling I have never experienced before as an avid reader of all forms.

It seems to me like the author has used quite a bit of the werewolf story as told in Twilight but with a pack about which very little is told and also tried to copy the style of S.Meyer's writing (as best she could..) with two very insecure teenagers as heroes but the story, oh the story is so painfully dull and predictable.

"what a load of rubbish!!!!!!!! please if you value your life do not buy this dvd, as you will never get theose hours back watching this stupid movie... i know i cant!!! i saw the trailers for it when it was in cinema and i was so excited about seeing it, but it never matched the hype....for one thing i never knew the whole film would be in subtitles. when the film started and it was 20 mins into it i thought please get better please have some sort of action...but i was disappointed...someone said in a review that the beginning was creating the tension and building up pace....errrr no it wasnt it was boring i nearly feel asleep. i found myself not following the subtitles thats how bad it was...then i didnt know what was goin on but the point was that i didnt care i just wanted to go. ive never walked out of a film in a cinema but i did with this film. when it got to the end with the assassination attempt of hitler it was so stupid...at least make the plot believeable. it was just all blood and violence and revenge thats all it was about for me.   also most reviews i see on here that give a five or four star rating mainly commented on how get it is on blu ray but not on the actual film...its all bout the quality something that this film def in my opinion lacks. if there was a no star rating thats what i would have given it!!!!",0

Field may have done this so that he wants to keep the readers' attention, but he really does over do it, which causes frustration. Not a good book if you want to be serious about your studies.",0

"Let down Firstly let me say that i am a massive daft punk fan. If you asked me to list my most favourite ten albums and songs then daft punk would feature on both lists.<br /><br />I was extermely excited about this new album and having listened to it was very let down, the album is the worst daft punk album by quite a bit if i am honest.<br /><br />Daft punk to me is about catchy dance/house music with good baselines and songs that make you want to dance with more limbs then you actually have, this album has a few songs that i would listen to on repeat but the others are eaasily forgettable, boring and not like daft punk at all.<br /><br />It is interesting that the new single featuring Pharell got to number one so is obviously very popular amongst people however it is so-so to me and i much prefer many of the remixes available on line that have less pharell and more bass/electronic. The single like most of the album is more akin to background music at a fancy do as it is smooth and repetitive and not like the old daft punk that you could dance like a mad man to in a club.<br /><br />I just hope if they tour that they focus more on the old stuff rather than the new direction they have headed in.",0

"A new blue tardis box, Mat Smith, and the intro music.....NOT A GOOD DECISION The story lines are ok but Mat Smith turning up in a brand new light blue TARDIS police box..... And the new intro music... to be honest it's just awful. The old TARDIS was the right colour a dark blue box with chipped corners and a few bumps and bruises bearing in mind it's been through a lot you would expect that. And an early 1900's police box wouldn't have perfectly sanded panels and a perfect paint job. The old TARDIS was just perfect. The intro music now sounds like it's been put together on a pc in 5 mins flat. And Mat Smith....well he's a nice guy for a children's TV show but not for the serious work of been an alien hero saving planets and everything else.

"PEDESTRIAN FARE BY ANNE RICE'S STANDARD! Lestat, the blood-sucking anti-hero who made his first appearance in Interview with the Vampire almost 40 years ago and was played by Tom Cruise in the 1994 blockbuster film, returns in a frighteningly spellbinding mystery-thriller from the iconic author of over thirty novels, including the ground-breaking The Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice.<br /><br />Though Prince Lestat is a stand-alone book, it may well be worth re-reading Anne’s earlier books like The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned in order to fully grasp the nature of the characters and how they all came into being. But re-acquainting oneself with the earlier books is not a must as one can still enjoy this latest offering from Anne Rice without having read them. Still, as the story begins from where The Queen of the Damned left off almost twenty-six years ago, many readers may like to go back and re-read the books.<br /><br />Prince Lestat: The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice is all about Lestat de Lioncourt, Armand, Akasha, Seth and the other vampires, and the changes they have to endure and what they are doing in the present. It is pertinent to note that the world they infested in 1998 is quite different from the world of today. Anne Rice painted a sweeping picture of how they are coming to terms with everything that happened to them, especially with Lestat, who is no longer what he once was. With huge responsibility on his shoulders as the leader of the tribe, he is constantly confronted with debilitating situations, as the vampires are at war with themselves.<br /><br />Prince Lestat: The Vampire Chronicles is entertaining and quite an enjoyable read for lovers of the genre. However, it is not what you expect from Anne Rice. In the past she has crafted some fabulous and stunning stories of vampires, their nature and character and measured against those stunning and marvelous works, Prince Lestat is a pedestrian fare.",0

"the worst maiden album It's all down to taste - some people like it some people don't.<br /><br />i don't. reasons being are it has no classic tunes to go back to in order to warrant the listen to it over and over. There is not a single track on here that i actually want to listen to more than a few times. I have listened to the album 3 times but the novelty of it wore off after that. there are plenty of other maiden albums that do get me to going back to them. it's a shame with this one because it's the only album i leave off a maiden playlist of all their albums.<br /><br />none of the songs are metal enough to the likes of their older AND newer stuff. when they returned to the classic lineup in 2000 and brought out brave new world, it was a shocker compared to virtual and x factor which were both imo great albums and i still listen to those. dance of death was also good but not as good as brave. i personally did not like a matter of life and death because again it feels just like final frontier - nothing classic, no catchy maiden tunes like wickerman, trooper, futureal, 2 minutes to midnight, can i play with madness, they simply don't exist on either this album or the last one before it.<br /><br />it's a no brainer also when you saw them live on the final frontier world tour that the setlist consisted of only a few songs from the latest album and more songs from past recent albums and the other half of the show was classic 80s tracks. in the earlier days and even in the reunion years most set lists had a heavy dose of the latest album tracks and a few classic tracks that everybody expected to hear anyway. the album has no real good tracks to play live, although yes they did play some of them live but not many at all. is that not part of the whole point of releasing a new album? to play it live? if it isnt good enough to play at least 5 tracks live, then something is seriously wrong.<br /><br />on the world slavery tour the set list was a heavy dose of powerslave material as well as some older stuff but thats how it SHOULD BE on every album release - good enough to easily play out live 5 new album tracks. final frontier simply isnt good enough. but it is good, however is not the best and imo the worst album they have done.<br /><br />it went to number 1 for 1 reason - its an iron maiden album. every fan in the millions across the world bought it whether it was crap or not - because it was a maiden album. the number 1 album title it got does not really reflect the excellent music, because there isnt any excellent music on this 1.me older stuff but thats how it SHOULD BE on every album release - good enough to easily play out live 5 new album tracks. final frontier simply isnt good enough. but it is good, however is not the best and imo the worst album they have done.<br /><br />it went to number 1 for 1 reason - its an iron maiden album. every fan in the millions across the world bought it whether it was crap or not - because it was a maiden album. the number 1 album title it got does not really reflect the excellent music, because there isnt any excellent music on this 1.",0
"The Bat  by Jo Nesbo Being an avid Jo Nesbo/Harry Hole fan, I had been counting the days until The Bat arrived - but what a disappointing read it has turned out to be. Had it been my first encounter with Harry Hole, I would probably not have read any more of Nesbo's books. I felt that the plot had great potential but that it became lost in the long descriptions of aboriginal culture. Interesting as it was, I felt that it detracted from the plot rather than enhanced it.

"8 ball pool I love playing this game. As you progress through the levels,and play harder opponents, the games can be quite challenging.<br /><br />There are a few rules that  are different to our British game of pool, but it is a first class game with excellent support from the Miniclip team.<br /><br />I only wish that each time you earn an achievement or win a tournament that you could be rewarded with a prize, for example a free scratch card, or free spin and win or bonus coins. You do not appear to win anything for earning an achievement award, I only have under 10 to achieve, perhaps you receive something when you achieve them all?<br /><br />I have also queried previously why the full amount of the 8 entrance fees are not paid out in the tournament's, for example in the first tournament 8 players each pay a 200 coin entrance fee, a total of 1600 coins. The winner receives 1000 coins with the runner up receiving 200 coins (entrance fee returned), what happens to the remaining 400 coins, why not pay the winner 1200 coins and the runner up 400? It is the same for all the tournament's but in the 1 v 1 matches the full amount is paid.<br /><br />The support team at miniclip are very good but they do take time answering queries, I still have some outstanding from February.

Yeah yeah yeah we have heard it all before haven't we? This is less of a review about the book and more about Richard and his writing/speech styles in general.  I think the best way to describe Richard is as the 8 year old that likes to make the younger kids cry by telling them Santa isn't real. A fairly apt metaphor considering that it is not a great stretch to imagine his books and to a degree his speechs were in fact written by a child. These tend to be little more than disjointed rants on how established religion is wrong. I would continue but I have better things to do than get into why you shouldn't spoil the magic for small children. Read one Dawkins book... then there is little more to gain from this.,0

"Reading """"Railway Man"""" I was intrigued by the subject matter.I am a Quaker and have heard tell of, and seen  photographic and other exhibitions of, peoples' real-life experience of forgiveness on occasions when this would have seemed impossible.<br />The cover cheapened the story but I suppose further supported the fact that it has been filmed.<br />It is written with realism and benefits from the fact that it includes Eric Lomax' early life.",1
"ONE OF THE WEAKEST DEAD'S YET Coming on the back of the enjoyable and clever \\""""Diary Of The Dead\\"""" it's sad to say that \\""""Survival Of The Dead\\"""" is quite a weak zombie film. Which is a pity as it seemed that George A. Romero had re awoken his own franchise with 2005's highly successful \\""""Land of the Dead\\"""". This movie just feels real weak compared to all previous entries, in fact the zombies barely play a part and there's no scenes that will have you jumping, Yes it could be to do with the budget of only 4 million but Romero's never really had big budgets before and after all \\""""Diary Of The Dead\\"""" only had a budget of 2 million.    The movie basically picks up where the last movie ends in that a bunch of renegade soldiers rob the belongings of the cast of \\""""Diary Of The Dead\\"""", while this is going on there's a war going on an island that is supposed to be zombie free. Of course everyone will descend on to this island and battle the zombies, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way and the story turns into who gets control of the island and the Zombies are really only in the background.    There is no extras included and the movie has a dated feel to it and if Romero's name wasn't attached to it we probably won't make it till the end. If you have seen the previous dead's then it's worth a look but if you only have a passing interest then don't bother!",0

"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Overall a good story, all the way through all 7 books I believed Snape was a basically good guy who just had a chip on his shoulder, even when he killed Dumbledore it had a conspiratorial air to it. Unfortunately his character goes out with a whimper which was a shame.<br />Anyway, this book starts well, but then deteriorates in to several hundred pages of camping that is completely irrelavant, unneccesary and thankfully will be missed out of the film. After a very dull middle, the ending was gripping but too rushed and short - the final few chapters from the return of Ron and finding the sword onwards should have been given more importance. I agree with other reviewers that some characters who died didn't kneed to - Lupin, Tonks, Fred etc, I expected Draco to have a bigger part in the end, bad or good, Lucius could have been sacrificed. Not too worried about Dumbledore - he was thinking of the greater good and probably didn't tell Snape the whole story anyway. Another question - how did Neville get the sword back off Griphook?<br />The eplilogue was a bit silly, why jump 19 years, are there plans for a new series???<br />My main issue with this book was this - I felt the writing style was out of step with the other books, so much so that I am now re reading \\""""Half Blood Prince\\"""" and to me they look like two different writers, comparing \\""""Half Blood Prince\\"""" to \\""""...Hallows\\"""" is like comparing Tolkiens \\""""Lord of the Rings\\"""" to Dan Browns \\""""DaVinci Code\\"""" - which one was written by a ghost wirter and which one by JKR? Some of the language is almost biblical - \\""""Smiting...?\\"""" and extremely ham fisted. I much prefer the previous book which I believe is the best of the series, closely followed by \\""""Prisoner of Azkaban\\"""". What could have been 5 stars for the story is downgraded because it looks like an ameteur wrote it.",0

"Very disapointing I almost put this book down a third of the way through but persevered as it was a present from my stepdaughter. As many others have said, none of the characters in the book are likeable and I found myself turning pages hoping they would all come to a nasty end...unfortunately not (except one). One of the most anticlimatic endings ever - I can only guess that the author is planning a sequel, which I will not be reading.",0

"So disappointing The band i love are clearly no more. The first three albums are insanely good. Puzzle is pretty good and then the slide starts. This isn't Biffy as i know them. Its a pop record. In fact it's worse, it's a Fall Out Boy Album.<br /><br />Its not the worst thing i've ever heard, but its not the best either. You can stick it on in the backround and it's completley inoffensive but if you pick any song off either cd and then play some kinda wixxard, justboy, liberate the illiterate, bodies in flight or man of his appaling stature, to name but a few of a great many, right after and you'll hear the difference. This doesn't rock. There is no dynamic shift volume wise between the loud and the quiet thus deadening any impact. The song structures which were once scattershot and deliciously all over the place are now predictable and dull.<br /><br />Biffy have now become just another band. Like the Kings of Leon and several others of that ilk, three great records and then descent into radio friendly inoffensive dullards whereupon it becomes impossible to differentate between the songs because they substituted rock for blandness, ticket sales and safety.<br /><br />I won't knock anyone for liking this, that's their call and i'm not that guy, but for me, not good.",0

"Good but the older ideas were better I've loved Leonard Cohen from the first time I heard 'The Songs of...' some 15 years after it's release, and then subsequently discovered the rest.  Cohen may place himself a hundred floors below Hank Williams in the Tower of Song but there weren't that many songs in the 20th Century that bettered 'Famous Blue Raincoat', 'If it Be Your Will','The Story of Isaac', 'The Stranger Song' or 'I can't forget' or....(substitute your own favourites).  Fantastic to see Cohen on the road again (whatever the reasons, and even if the shows themselves were a bit slick and over rehearsed it was a joy just to be there) and now making a new LP.  But whilst he undoubtedly has something new to say about the ageing process from within his own unique myth(ology) is what he says (and how he says it) really on a par with his best work?  The murmur of his voice gives real atmosphere but the songs are slight in comparison to the really great ones in his astonishing canon.  5 stars? Maybe for the uniqueness, the staying power, the heritage.  But if being judged purely on the work itself this is nowhere near the real 5 stars work of, for example, 'Songs of Love and Hate' (at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others agonisingly visceral) or 'I'm Your Man' (some of the best tunes and some of the finest and funniest and touching of his words).  We shouldn't insult the man by suspending all critical judgement - he deserves better than that.",0
typical Its the kind of book where once you've read it you never want to read it again. No offence I am a massive hills fan and was intrigued to see lauren conrads book.

"Be aware that it is a concert! I bought this recently after watching the 10th anniversary show and adoring it. However, it was not made particularly obvious that this, being a concert at the O2, is more about the singing and there is a very small amount of acting involved. I was also personally not a fan of a few of the performances, for example Matt Lucas. However, Lea Salonga was fantastic as a star risen from Eponine to Fantine and I was pleasantly surprised by the work of Nick Jonas. Alfie Boe gave a good performance but I am always to be biased by the pure talent that is Colm Wilkinson. The vocal performance given by Ramin Karimloo was always going to be something spectacular after his roles as Raoul and the Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera and he did not disappoint. Perhaps a more prominent role would have been suited though. All in all, a good [u]CONCERT[/u] provided that you know what you're getting. I would just prefer to see a show",0

"ARE WE THERE YET? Lee Child seems to make a point of describing Reacher's build in detail - from his 6'5\\"""" frame, 3XLT clothing, 50\\"""" chest, and large hands and long arms (that almost drag the ground when he is seated in a chair).  Perhaps this is to reinforce the fact that Reacher is NOT the diminutive Tom Cruise as Hollywood appears to have insisted.  With a freshly broken nose held together with a piece of silver duct tape, Reacher is having a difficult time hitching a ride.  It is a cold night in Nebraska and fifty-six cars have already passed him by.  When number fifty-seven finally stops to offer him a lift Reacher steps into a new adventure that is part suspense thriller and part political commentary, a place where everything and everyone are not what they seem to be.  The only constant is Reacher.  He is still the strong, silent ex-military cop who travels via his thumb and owns only one set of clothes at a time.<br /><br />A WANTED MAN gives us a look at government run hotels, counterterrorism units including the ongoing dual between the FBI, CIA and local law enforcement organizations, the un-surprising disclosure that every embassy in the world has a \\""""trade attach&eacute;\\"""" which is just another word for a functioning covert operative (spy).  The reader is also privy to the machinations behind banking operation that deals in a most unusual form of \\""""currency\\"""".<br /><br />The first half of the book moves along pretty slowly as Child slowly unveils all the players in this game and lays out the intricate details and it is not until the second half of the book that all the marbles begin to fall into place.  This offering is more atmospheric as not as addictive or adrenaline fueled as some of the other Reacher adventures,  and while it will not take a place among my favorites in this series, it is nonetheless a pretty good read.",0

"A curate's egg. I had mixed feelings when I bought this film.  On the one hand it got lukewarm reviews from critics on release.  On the other hand, it's an Aardman film which should guarantee a certain level of quality.<br /><br />On watching the film I've decided it's a bit of a mixture.  The story is based on the concept of Santa as a dynasty rather than a single individual and revolves around Arthur(James McEvoy), the younger son of the current Santa.  Arthur is a well meaning but clumsy chap who has been assigned post room duties to keep him from unintentionally disrupting the smooth running of Santa's organisation.  That smooth running is down to elder brother Steve(Hugh Laurie) who runs Christmas with military precision.  He has devised a massive computerised control centre and a 150,000mph giant sleigh which looks like a spaceship.  Crack teams of elves abseil from the ship er sleigh to break into homes and prepare the way for Santa(Jim Broadbent)...who doesn't appear to do very much at all.<br /><br />This part of the film is very well done and answers many of those niggling questions kids have about how Santa actually gets things done.  The Christmas delivery scenes unfold at a frantic pace which doesn't let up until deliveries are over and Santa is back at base.  The S1 Sleigh is beautifully realised and lovingly shot like a spacecraft complete with lens flare when it turns in front of the rising sun.  The base is a vast mission control with ranks of elves sitting at computer screens tracking and controlling the Christmas delivery.<br /><br />Santa is thinking of retirement.  He can't keep up with Steve's technology or organisational skills.  Steve is counting the days until he becomes Santa.  Arthur meanwhile, is happy to sit in the post room, sorting and answering letters.  Unfortunately for Steve, a single gift goes undelivered and he and Santa make a management decision not to bother going back out with it.  Appalled by this decision (as was I - poor characterisation) Arthur enlists the help of his Grandad(Bill Nighy) who was the previous Santa.  Together they liberate an old sleigh and some reindeer that Grandad had been training on the sly.  They then set out to deliver the last present. In this they are aided by feisty elf Bryony(Ashley Jensen), a kind of ninja wrapping commando who puts the cowardly bumbling Arthur to shame with her bravery and determination.<br /><br />This section of the film is where things go off track a little.  Arthur and Grandad experience various mishaps which include being stranded on a beach, attacked by lions and being shot at by the military.  There are periods when Arthur is having his doubts and these drag the film down a little.  I find it difficult to believe that Santa would elect not to deliver the final present because it was too much bother.  The military reaction to the discovery of a wooden craft flying through the sky on Christmas morning is somewhat preposterous too, especially when you know that NORAD operates a Santa tracking website every year.<br /><br />The film draws to a close with the whole family working together to deliver the last gift.  Mrs Christmas spurs her husband into taking action and helps the Christmas family to realise that teamwork is the key to ensuring a successful Christmas.  (Although it is only hinted at in the film, Mrs Christmas is obviously the power behind the team and takes care of the political stuff like agreeing treaties with Greenland).  Following a complaint about plot spoilers I have amended this part of the review and will say no more about how the film turns out.<br /><br />Somehow this film has all the ingredients bar one - Christmas magic.  That just seems to be lacking.  This may be partly due to the characters.  They are a little too flawed.  Arthur is likeable enough apart from a really annoying laugh.  Santa is portrayed as totally out of his depth yet willing to take the credit for running an operation he doesn't even understand.  Steve is too much like a puffed up corporate exec interested only in the logistics of Christmas.  Grandad is a weaselly old man obsessed by showing that he can still do Christmas.  The film is a good watch, on a par with Flushed Away but it will never supplant Polar Express or Muppet Christmas Carol in my heart.<br /><br />Update January 2013.  My son watched this movie a lot over the Christmas period declaring it to be the best Christmas movie ever.  I've watched it 2 or 3 times myself and it has grown on me somewhat.  Maybe I'll review my star rating next Christmas.s too much like a puffed up corporate exec interested only in the logistics of Christmas.

"A lot of hocus pocus? Not quite sure what I was expecting here, having only read ( I think)  'The Illustrated Man' in my far-off youth; what I wanted was a creepy, thought-provoking novel about impending evil, with, given Bradbury's screenwriting experience, terse prose and plausible dialogue. The book has a reputation as a classic, but if there's one thing you should never pay attention to when it comes to books (or films, or restaurants, or the opposite sex, or anything really), it's reputation.<br />What we have is something that reads like an almost plotless literary experiment. One late October day, a strange carnival, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to Green Town, Illinois. Two thirteen year-old boys, excitable, annoying Will Halloway, and his more troubled friend Jim Nightshade, become attracted/repelled by the carnie's bizarre acts and rides (most notably a merry-go-round that can alter a rider's age), and are then dragged into a life and death struggle with the carnival's owner, Mr Dark, The Illustrated Man.<br />The boys do a lot of running hither and thither, a lot of climbing in and out of their bedroom windows and a lot of shouting of each other's names. There are many unwelcome homilies to the wonder of books (Will's father Charles works in the local, amazingly well-stocked library) and long pontificating on the nature of evil.  Italics and exclamation marks litter the prose in a way that almost every modern writer would disdain. The prose itself is verbose, baroque and bloated with adjectives and hybrid phrases...as in this description of Mr Dark: 'Mr Dark came carrying his panoply of friends, his jewel-case assortment of calligraphical reptiles which lay sunning themselves at midnight on his flesh. With him strode the stich-linked Tyrannosaurus Rex, which lent to his haunches a machined and ancient wellspring mineral-oil glide. As the thunder lizard strode, all glass-bead pomp, so strode Mr Dark armored with vile lightning scribbles of carnivores and sheep-blasted by that thunder and arun before storms of juggernaut flesh...' (there are another hundred words of this). Eyes are 'fright-coloured', teeth 'panic-coloured', hands are 'snug-clapped' to mouths, and Bradbury seems to be on a mission to use the words 'shadow' and 'moon' as often as possible.<br />It would be a dull world, obvs, where everyone wrote like Hemingway, but to me this kind of faux-poetry is stodgy, and worse, obscures meaning, and even worse than that, kills tension and scariness. Though there are truly unsettling concepts in the book, the runaway-train exuberance of the prose and the ambling, goes-nowhere story means they are seriously under-explored.<br />Charles Halloway's own analysis of the kind of books he imagined himself writing sums up Bradbury's novel: \\""""Now it all seemed fireworks, done for color, sound, the high architecture of words, to dazzle the boys, powder his ego, but with no mark left on retina or mind after the color and sound faded; a mere exercise in self-declamation'.",0

However i would have been pretty disappointed paying any more than £100 for it!  Was looking forward to receiving the item and when i did, my first impression again was disappointment! The box i found to lack quality for such a prolific band, the cd's cases are quite flimsy and fiddly when getting them out of the box and when trying to get the cd's and booklets out and back in them again it was to be a pretty painful experience and overtime the cases will become very worn! The material in the booklets is very limited especially in comparison to the beatles box set and remastered albums, much better quality and value for money!  The music on the discs has slightly better sound, but whether this constitutes in buying the newly remastered cd's i would say definitely not!! If you have these albums already I wouldn't bother with this, unless you got it at a cut down price like myself! I would summarise by saying the packaging is a major let down, which could have been made so much better, the music is still good as it was!",0

"Not so Kick-ass after all I'll get this out of the way first. I think the movie was better. I generally enjoy Millar's work, being a big fan of the Ultimates and Old Man Logan, but Kick-ass is a thoroughly depressing puerile mess.    THe movie, while it was pretty dark, also had a lot of light moments to balance it out as well as having a, perhaps unrealistic, but ultimately feel-good ending. The comic has no such luck. The main character is a fairly accurate representation of a teenager in many ways, but this also makes him a thoroughly unlikeable person and it's pretty hard to root for him in some cases. Perhaps it is a true interpretation of what this guy would be like, but that doesn't make for a fun read.    Millar seems to have written a lot of the stuff in here for shock value and to create as much violent confrontations as possible. Admittedly the movie is violent too, but the way it's shot manages to not make it disgusting. Every panel of kick-ass is drenched in blood and Romita Jr's ugly art style doesn't help at all. There's also a lot of moments that make the supporting characters out to be even more ****ed up than they are in the film such as Big Daddy and Red Mist.    Ultimately, Kick-ass is not necessarily badly written, it's a competent idea with great potential, but Millar's used it as an excuse to be as violent, sweary and depressing as possible. If you have a cynical view on life this'll be right up your street.",0

"Mistake I've spent a lot of time deliberating which version is more worth buying: ordinary or deluxe edition. Ultimately I decided for the latter option due to not huge difference in prize. And I was wrong. I knew Heaven anhd Hell very well as absolutely great album with incredible Dio's vocal (however not reaching the hights he showed with Rainbow), but hadn't got it in my collection. The first disc is an unchanged (luckily) version of the album. The second contains concert and bbc versions and I hope noone else will fall for buying it. The songs not only bring nothing new but are awfully mixed with Dio's vocal sounds like from a well with great difficulty to go through vibrating music.  Normally Heaven and Hell would have five stars as it deserves. I think I don't have to explain I don't like any album standing on the shelf uselessly, even when it relates only to part of it.

"Needed a 'Filip' ! Well, after all the hype surrounding this movie, it's actually just okay and seems to me as if it cries out to be a 15 and not the 12 that it was chosen to be rated. It's based on fact, so some extra dramatization was, in my view, desperately called for here. Without the obvious talent of Hanks, I would even have dropped this to two stars. It's just not very exciting, gripping, or in any particular way, captivating. And the talk of Barkhad Abdi sailing off into the sunset with a Best Supporting Actor nomination in frankly ludicrous - he does ok, but just okay, IMHO. Maybe he gets the sympathy vote, i.e. 'Somalian street kid does good' and all that. Don't be taken in! Also,given the known terror dangers within those waters off Somalia, why on earth arn't these ships armed with machine guns, grenades etc to 'take out' the perpetrators. The final scene on the outboard is neither tense or anything else, but it is rather claustrophobic with, ok, a bloody shoot out, but then it's the end and it rather leaves you thinking ( or at least if left ME thinking) umm ...wanted rather more...

"C Pass but could do better With all of the 5 star reviews I feel I'm bursting the bubble somewhat, but reading a couple of less than 5 star reviews, I feel I share their sentiment.  I haven't bought a Hard Rock album for a little while as there has been little to stand out from the usual formula.   After dipping my toe into the first album \\""""One Day Remains\\"""" when it first came out (on the strength of Creed), I wanted to love this band but every time I played the album, I found it difficult to play it right through. Whilst the music is well executed, it sounds the same on most tracks. The new magic sound, or style I'm looking for is missing.   I guess I'm looking for the kick I got when when I first played P.O.D. Satellite (the first few tracks are amazing). It's the wow factor that is missing from Alter Bridge! They are very accomplished as musicians but I can't help feeling they can do much much better.  In \\""""One Day Remains\\"""", Myles Kennedy does have impressive vocals and he seems to effortlessly hit the notes. But it seems to me that he doesn't know how to get the most out of it. After a few songs I got tired of his droaning. It's like Maradona when he was 5 stone overweight.  So onto \\""""Blackbird\\"""" and given the 5 star reviews I was hoping for a treat. The first track does not disappoint. Ties That Bind hits the spot! Strong riff to start, drums kick in, every now and then the offbeat, deep vocal start, more driving riffs, followed by power in the vocals. That little pause, that explosion of vocal, nothing new, but so well done! Cool!  But sadly the album fades from here...  The only other highlight is \\""""Before Tomorrow Comes\\"""". Wow! Melodic opening, deep vocals again, the uplift of the vocals, the power of the song gives you the goosebumps, wahhh a ahhh a a awah, superb. This should be shouting single all the way up the charts!  Rise Today immediately follows but the lyrics remind me of a Def Leppard effort. Oh dear, so close but no cigar.  So what is wrong with this album? It's fair to say it'sworth a listen. But how many people who buy it, will sort of initially like it and then shuffle it to the back of their collection.   Alter Bridge are defined by their guitar work and vocals. They need to play back the songs and be ruthless with anything less than perfect. Harsh but fair. Maybe a producer like Mutt Lang can turn them from very good and make the sound great. I'll buy the 3rd album with hope whenever it comes out. I hope the band are critcial with this one",0

"Its the great rock and roll swindle itself! Only its not rock and roll at all really right bono?    Words cannot really describe my contempt for this most over-rated and unworthy of bands. so what have we here then? well - start with the cover - a semi-pornographic picture of a man about to commit oral sex on another under the title 'songs of innocence'. Oh, how 'artistic' we are these days eh bono? How 'modern age' we are.    Then we have the next move - giving this away 'free' on itunes. Only you see, its not really 'free' cos the band were paid 100 million for doing it! only a band as rich and contrived as this would pull such a stunt. Get with the modern age they say! give your music away free! (only it wasnt free right bono?) never mind the thousands of bands out there struggling to get their music heard and bought and trying to make a living in this most treacherous of businesses - give your music away for nothing! (only it wasnt for nothing was it bono?)    So now we come to the music. Oh look, a song to kick the album off dedicated to joey ramone. wow, how cool can you be eh bono you lame, contrived worthless peice of excrement? but i digress - sorry - the music - well, you know how it goes. its shimmery, its shiny. its big jangly guitars over a a glossy sheeny production. Spineless , souless, passionless.  And these pretenders have the gall to call themselves a rock band!    Oh yes you bet your life i hate this band. As for the poor saps who actually go out there and buy into this swindle - i feel a bit sorry for you as obviously something is very amiss in your lives",0

"What's it all about - Alfie Didn't understand what this sleep inducing nonsense was all about. It was certainly very dull and poorly crafted.

Something just didn't grab me with this film, I can not quite put my finger on what Is lacking. I did watch it to the end and I am not sure if for me it was more the acting that I found dry. On the contrary the little girl is a fabulous little actress.May give it one more go but for now after the hype I have read I think 2 out of 5 is where I feel best for me.",0
It just gets better and better. What an a amazing read! Well written and fantastic story that just gets better with every book. To call it a page turner is an understatement.

"I like running and I like Murakami but this book was truly a chore I was really excited by this book as I'd read a couple of Murakami books and thoroughly enjoyed them. I'd heard someone speaking of this book as finally capturing the moment of zen that is running.    Perhaps it does, but if so it is within a few tucked away sentences. The idea that the thrill of running could be communicated by over a hundred pages of monotonic, drab descriptions of yet another marathon is just depressing - surely there's so much more to it? There certainly is to Murakami.    I think this book had a lot of potential. Occasionally it turns autobiographical which provides us with a slight relief and you learn a fair bit about running. Ultimately, however, there is only enough content for a chapter of a book.",0
"Frustrating read I am finding this book very hard to read. The style of writing is tedious and there is not much content in every paragraph you read. The way the TDD thought process and its inevitable conflicts are portrayed seems childish and distracts the reader more than anything.<br />The author is trying very hard to be entertaining but that is not what I'm looking for in a TDD book. Take the following excerpt for instance:<br />\\""""You aren't thinking about the implementation of equals(), are you? Good. Me Neither. After snapping the back of my hand with a ruler, I'm thinking about how to test ...\\""""<br />This book is full of comments like this which I found unnecessary and distracting. I was expecting a `more to the point' style of writing which unfortunately, this book fails to deliver.",0

"A disquieting insight into the world of the 21st Century snake oil salesman I borrowed this book from a friend. At the time I was trying to find a way to run a small business whilst juggling with the uncertainties of long-term health issues. The title of the book was intriguing.<br /><br />And certainly, there are some sensible ideas in this book -  albeit mostly concentrated in the first few pages - on time management.  Like not answering your phone and only replying to emails at designated times. Obvious? Well, not always. However one of the best suggestions was to not feel obliged to read a book all the way to the final paragraph.<br /><br />With regard to Ferriss' own book, such advice seemed well placed, for long before I got anywhere near the final chapter I felt myself losing the will to live.<br /><br />I also had this disquieting feeling I'd accidently strayed into the territory of some rather nasty cult, the kind that would sell its own daughters to old men in exchange for something that would provide another quick high. The basic premise seemed to be, find something - anything, ANYTHING, ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING -  that you can persuade (or con) large numbers of people into buying. Obviously, at the highest possible price.<br /><br />Outsource everything to the third world, have various  auf wiederzehn/plausible deniability strategies in place for when things go wrong,  and  away you go. Dead easy.<br /><br />Consequences? In the snake oil salesman's world, there aren't any.  Provided of course you  remain appropriately out of sight (for more on this theme, read Howard Marks).<br /><br />The irony seemed to be, that for all the eons of time Ferriss claims to have freed up in his own life - in order to pursue his various hedonistic but often vacuous interests, it doesn't quite ring true. He tries hard to make a convincing case but ultimately falls well short.<br /><br />Instead, the picture is of a rather sad individual forever chasing that one final fix -  whether it be a triad of nubile girls,  the ultimate wave break or merely the acclaim he clearly thinks he deserves for  being so incredibly incredibly brilliant -  that will fix everything. And in this respect the growing collection of generic titles under Ferriss' authorship (most likely ghost-written by someone in Mumbai earning $6 an hour) seems little more than another means to that end, as in more snake oil.cclaim he clearly thinks he deserves for  being so incredibly incredibly brilliant -  that will fix everything.

"Surprisingly disappointing The re-mastered  version does have improvements over the original.  The SACD quality is questionable though and not helped by the fact that the centre and SB channels have not been used. I would not recommend this for a top end sound system as the shortcomings of the original quadraphonic mix that is used for the SACD layer become very evident (wow and flutter). I found the best quality I got was from the normal CD layer running through the AV system.   If you're an avid Mike Oldfield fan then it might be worth considering this for your collection, otherwise the higher price tag is not worth it. I would rather have bought two standard Mike Oldfield CD's for the price of this one.",0
"meh Not sure where to begin really - this book was all over the place.<br /><br />The sections involving Kaladin and Szeth are pretty engaging, however the sections involving Shallan and Dalinar are woeful.<br /><br />It's as if the author had a good adventure piece in mind with a dash or sword and sorcery, however to seem a more enlightened writer he felt he absolutely had to add another element - unfortunately in this case the extra `element' is torpid and full of endless supposition.<br /><br />Somewhere in here is a decent story that's just drowned in a dull counter part to the action<br /><br />All in all I wish I'd borrowed this from my local library rather than forking out cash for it.",0
"St Swithin's Day (recurring....) At first I was rather annoyed by both Em's prudishness and Dex's public school playboy persona's, but as they meet up every 15th July for St Swithin's day, we do warm to them. Their influences on each other soften the worst of these two personality traits, even though I still found Jim Sturgess (Dex) rather unlikable through to the end. Anne Hathaway, as Em, dons a perfect English accent though some of her straight-laced manners are a little stereotyped (bookish glasses, long, dull dresses etc)<br /><br />Meeting at Uni and after a fling that doesn't really happen, through a series of time-signposted snapshots, we see them re-uniting, either in person or by phone. He moved to Paris, has always got a girl of some sort and is often drunk or in some kind of trouble. She finds solace in working as a trainee teacher and scatty would-be comic Rafe Spall, who's pulling phrase to her  just has to be \\""""let's go on an Ovaltine bender!\\"""".<br /><br />I haven't read the book on which it's based - and won't be - and saw it on Sky Movies premier, so won't be buying the DVD. However, the various locations - England and France - have a certain resonance and place and familiarity, of course, which is sort of comforting. I did find the satellite characters often more interesting than the main pair - Dex's parents, for example. Patricia Clarkson as his mum and Ken Stott as dad; she wise and loving but cancer-ridden and he, hasty, brusque and forthright - typical of so many real parents.<br /><br />The film pretty much follows this vein throughout though their fortunes and life-courses are swapped around and changed. After relationship difficulties for them both, could they ever get back together as a proper couple? I won't say anything much about the end except perhaps that life itself is key to what happens to us and not screenwriters and romanticists.<br /><br />Whilst being slightly 'icky' at times, this was nonetheless a fairly enjoyable movie experience but not one I'd particularly want to see again. I'd give it nearer 3.5 stars than the three I clicked on and whilst Hathaway has done a good job and was fairly memorable, the rest is pretty much standard, if slightly above average romantic drama.want to see again.

"Tough to give a Grey's Series 3 Stars but..... A good series but the quality seems to be dipping.    George's funeral had a typically Darkly-Comic vibe to it when the remaining 4 residents burst out laughing afterwards but paradoxically remained true to the show we have come to love.    The arrival of the new Residents in the wake of the merger (where are all the Mercy West Attendings?) seemed to be a way to introduce new characters into the show and have them \\""""road tested\\"""" before making any of them permanent.  We have: Jackson Avery, April Kepner, Reed Adamson and Charles Percy as the main new cast members joining SGH from MWH (It's now Seattle-Grace/Mercy-West Hospital)    The series starts off with the inevitable clashes between the new residents and the old with numerous territory fights and general underhand antics. Lexie clashes with April, Izzie clashes with Charles and all the Attendings seem oblivious to the lack of team spirit among their doctors.    A new Cardio Attending arrives in the form of Teddy Altman, a fellow surgeon of Owen's from Iraq, who he recommended to Richard ostensibly to get her a great new job but really as a \\""""present\\"""" to Christina who wanted a new Cardio Attending. Teddy is another character who I feel fits in very well within the cast, unlike the Mercy West Residents. This however is likely due to the way they are all written. Teddy is accepted by her fellow Attendings almost instantly whereas the MW Residents feel that the SG Residents are \\""""cliquey\\"""" and do not accept them.    It should be noticed that in Ep 5, wait for it..... IZZIE LEAVES! HURRAH!  I cannot tell you how pleased I was to see her go, despite the fact that I liked Alex having Meredith as his best man at his wedding I continued to dislike Izzie and her departure caused me nothing but pleasure.    One of my favorite episodes in this series is \\""""I saw what I saw\\"""" (Ep6) in which the death of a patient is investigated after the fact through flashbacks in a \\""""whodunnit?\\"""" style episode. This episode culminates in the firingof April Kepner who missed a basic step and missed the patients damaged airway.  It also paves the way for confrontations between Derek and Richard to come to the forefront of the plot as Derek blames Richard for the mistake due to the lack of leadership he is (not) demonstrating resulting in a chaotic system that harms patients.    Another great episode is Ep7 \\""""Give Peace a Chance\\"""" In which a hospital technician (Isaac) gives Derek scans of a massive spinal tumour and asks him to operate, it is Isaac's tumour. This episode mixes superbly the conflict between Derek and Richard along with the tense nature of the surgery which eventually comes down to one final cut with doctors watching from the gallery and Christina updating Meredith over the phone.    It is later revealed that Richard is drinking again and likely operating under the influence of alcohol.  Derek informs the board and is made chief. He hires back people fired as a result of the merger and sets about his new job with gusto.  I felt that this storyline, despite seeming vindictive on the part of Derek at times, was more realistic than they could have made it. I liked that Derek basically admitted that he wanted to be Chief and was using this as his opportunity. That being said I also liked Derek's actions after he was made Chief in continuing to support Richard and prevent the board from actually firing him.    My joy at Izzie leaving is short lived however as she returns at the behest of Meredith but quickly leaves after Alex tells her to go (YAY!) saying that he now knows he is a good man and that he doesn't deserve to be treated the way Izzie has acted towards him.  The eventual conclusion to the Izzie storyline satisfied me overall, I was hoping that they would not continue to bring Izzie back all season and they obliged me by not doing so. All that remains is to see if she turns up in Season 7 (God I hope not!)    The storylines throughout the middle of the series do not have any real \\""""pop\\"""" to themand merely serve as filler episodes until the big finale.    (The finale and the beginning are all the make this series in anyway good)    Onto the finale. I enjoyed the finale immensely. After a fairly lacklustre middle to the series it was a huge shock when everything kicked off around Gary Clarke.    Overall. This series started well, the atmosphere of apprehension amid the merger had me nervous as to the fate of the Residents but after they all made friends it was lost. Up until episode 7 I really enjoyed this series but after \\""""Give Peace a Chance\\"""" I think the quality dipped and even the introduction of Kim Raver (24 Alum) as Teddy Altman wasn't enough to pull the middle of the series to a decent level of quality and as such it didn't really grab me.    The finale was a great two hours and the extended episode on the DVD is definitely worth watching.    All that is to say that I still found the series interesting and would still watch it again, it just doesn't live up to that which came before it.  The 3 stars is not actually intended to be a negative review, merely average. I think the beginning and end of this series were both great but I just never really enjoyed the middle. But if you are a Grey's fan then you should watch this!",0

"A fine book, but written by a different Terry Pratchett This was an interesting and well written book. The problem is that it is not up to the usual extraordinary standards of Terry Pratchett, Since he was first diagnosed with his illness there has been a gradual slippage in the style and quality of the books, and this seems like the first time that it is obviously not the same writer. Some of the humour and joy has gone out of the Discworld, and instead we are just left with the message, and it is obvious why this has happened, no blame can be attached to Terry and it is admirable that he is able to still work at such a level.

Its good but not great, its good to see the couple we have all been waiting for get together at last but the show has traded in the gritty drama for comedy. I like comedy i do but bones was always had good gripping drama to keep us entertained. The season finale redeems itself slightly. The birth of christine booth and brennans daughter was so cheesy it made me cringe. It was good to see our favourite couple cope with the usual problems of living together, moving house and such. I have watched the first few eps of season 8 and there seems to be more drama so i am pleased for that.

"I expected better We need to talk about Kevin is a novel that describes the years leading up to the day when Kevin murders a number of his fellow high school students and two high school employees. The story is told through a series of letter from his mother, Eva to his father, Franklin and explores whether Eva's attitude and approach to motherhood influenced Kevin's behaviour.<br /><br />The idea behind We need to talk about Kevin is a good one however the book lacks substance. I found Eva's early letters long and tiresome as she complains about everything and everyone.  It is no surprise that she dislikes being pregnant and motherhood brings her no joy as she appears not to be able to find the joy in anything. The main theme is based on the simplified theory that when a child, especially a son, acts outside of the laws of society then it can be directly connected to their relationship with their mother.<br /><br />The portrayal of the main characters makes this a difficult novel to continue to read as the novel progressed I found that I wasn't connected to the characters and therefore lacked any real interest in their lives. The characters are all one dimensional; Kevin is portrayed as mean and moody, Franklin is portrayed as weak and ineffective and Celia is portrayed as overly sensitive and over eager to please. The relationship between Kevin and his mother is over simplified she does not appear to love him, she views him as an almost demonic incarnation and seems to regret the day he was conceived. Kevin in turn is aware of his mother's feelings towards him and acts accordingly.<br /><br />The second half of book is flows better than the first half and I can completely understand why some did not read the book to the end.<br /><br />My overall view of this book is it tackles am interesting subject in a tiresome manner. We may need to talk about Kevin but 500 pages dedicated to his mother's negative feelings about her son is a little excessive.",0

"A real stinker I am no literary snob, and enjoy reading fiction of all kinds, but I really did think this was complete rubbish. The plot is unoriginal, the characters two dimensional, cliched, and frequently ridiculous, the dialog so bad it had me laughing out loud (as did some of the sex scenes). I can easily imagine the author having to throw this together to meet the demands of a publishing contract, the publisher in turn, has published it knowing that the authors name is enough to ensure sales.<br />This book is the literary equivalent of a dog turd, step over it, step around it, but whatever you do don't pick it up, it's a stinker!",0

If a HSP had wrote a book like this it would be from their heart and soul it would be deep and personal.

Elaine N Aron is nomore a HSP as I am santa clause. Any real HSP will know its contents are crap after reading the first few pages. The only thing she knows about HSPs is how to wined them up.

Good but not as good as I thought it would be I'm not usually a follower of fashion when it comes to reading books but after all the praise this received I decided to take advantage of a long journey to listen to the audiobook.Martin Wenner reads well and for the most part I enjoyed his voice characterisation except importantly the voice he used for Lisbeth. He pronounced all the names the Swedish way which was a nice touch but then had Lisbeth speaking with a 'Mockney' accent which grated on my ear and detracted from an otherwise pleasurable reading. The story was interesting and until I read about Steig Larsson's life I thought some of the violence was a bit gratuitous. I had guessed who the baddy was quite sometime before they were revealed and had long since guessed the twist but if you're needing something to while away the hours on a long journey it's certainly worth giving this audio cd a listen to.,0

Four Stars Good app,1
"opportunity lost? All in all I enjoyed this first season quite a lot.<br />Professionally scripted, filmed and acted, it heavily relies on the charm of the Arthurian myth and on the free use of magic so fashionable these years providing the viewer with hours of easy entertainment. A little TOO easy at times.<br />Said viewer could be even a child of about 10 if a parent were there to do some explaining.<br /><br />That the main purpose of this series be entertainment is perfectly legitimate, but I am convinced that things could and should have been done better even within this limited scope.<br /><br />First and foremost there are heavy qualitative differences in the 13 episodes: scripted and directed by different people they are remarkably different in achievements. Take for instance the episode before the last: throughout there is great attention paid to lighting, to framing and composition. The result is that this episode is vastly superior from every point of view. And it shows, it really does. Why was this attention not paid to all of them?<br />Another irritating problem is the actors' diction: in the first episode it is very theatrical, cristal clear, perfect. Elsewhere, but not everywhere, the same actors slur whole sentences forcing me to use subtitles. Why? Have the creators not established guidelines?<br />They should have. The series is full of inconsistencies (and sketchy plots/characterization/ethics). For example at the start Merlin is said to be capable of making spells with no mouthed incantation. Elsewhere he has to speak just to open a closed door. Sorry, but these mistakes irritate me a lot.<br /><br />To talk about some inconsistencies forces me to introduce others that may be less relevant if one accepts that this series was originally meant for entertainment only. I can see that it might as well be only me who wishes for more attention to be paid to details.<br />The Arthurian myth is extraordinarily confused but if I am not wrong the life of Arthur is supposed to be set in the first centuries A.D. when the Roman army was retiring from Britain and the Latin-Celtic world was collapsing into small states, often at war with each other and facing the first waves of the Anglo-Saxon invasion.<br />I might be wrong but this series seems to be set much later, when Anglo-Saxons were already established and mixed with the rest: Arthur's father is called Uther, for instance, and there are runes -which are Germanic only- everywhere. I am under the impression that most incantations are pronounced in Old English instead of some kind of Celtic. Camelot itself is an enormous, full fledged castle, something I would expect in the X century or even later and several details in the scenes appear to be wrong.<br />Another point is the choice of black actors. Those playing Gwen and her father especially, but there were quite a lot of extras too.<br />Do NOT misunderstand me: they are fine professionals, I loved them, but I somehow doubt that in V century Britain there were so many people of colour, not to mention among the knights.<br />A further point is that the dialogues/gestures and even ethics sound too modern for the time. Was this really necessary for entertainment's sake? Was it not possible to fetch an historian and have him revise the production while preserving the fun?<br /><br />There are several other points I could make but I shall leave it to you to decide for yourself; allow me to stress that a little more accuracy would have been welcomed.<br />Some less sketchy dialogues would have been too: all actors do a decent job and could surely afford better lines and deeper ethics/attitudes.<br /><br />An interesting issue other reviewers have pointed out are the homosexual undertones in the series, especially -and understandably- in the relationship between Arthur and Merlin. Nothing for prudes to worry about though, there is nothing explicit as there is nothing sexual of any sort in any line of the script for any character in the whole first season. It is just a feeling.hole first season. It is just a feeling.",0

"Dreadful on so many levels These books are dreadful on so many levels, it's difficult to know where to start.<br /><br />1. The author doesn't know whether he wants to write a parallel worlds science fiction story, or a sword and sorcery fantasy story. Clearly, he thinks there is important science content here, but he doesn't understand the first thing about science. He must have sat down with some Oxford Uni physics dons and quizzed them about dark matter, but then he made a complete mockery of this scientific concept by turning it into a sort of tinkerbell magic dust that can be seen by humans and has an emotional and moral significance - WTF?<br />And all the magic stuff about 'daemons' and witches (witches??? on broomsticks??? Give me strength!) is silly beyond words.<br />So, either write about magic stuff, or write about scientific stuff if you understand it (which the author doesn't - he threw it in to impress the reader with his supposed erudition); mixing the two so carelessly is, well, silly.<br /><br />2. Parallel worlds - here we get talking bears who can work metal. Great. I mean, utterly silly, but OK, if you must: it's a parallel world. But a parallel world is not going to HAVE talking bears who can work metal: it'll have the same bears as ours, or more likely it won't have them at all, because they wouldn't have evolved ... if talking carnivores HAD evolved, they wouldn't be terrestrial bears who can talk and work metal.<br />This is just one example of the author's lack of scientific understanding (and the moral 'dust', of course). There are plenty more.<br /><br />3. The author hates the church. OK, we get it. They are all evil. Well, maybe they are and maybe they aren't. But if he is an atheist, how come he believes in magic, and how come he believes in angels (!), and how come he believes in the existence of god (!!!), albeit a somewhat different type of god? This is poor, really poor. The point of atheism is that all these things are not supposed to exist!<br /><br />4. Visiting the world of the dead. The less we say about this utterly ludicrous nonsense, the better.<br /><br />5. The books are full of nastiness and sadism. I mean, serious nastiness and sadism.<br /><br />6. The author's smugness at his own supposed cleverness is very noticeable and highly irritating. Yes, we get it: anbar is related to the Semitic word for amber, i.e. the Greek 'elektron', hence anbaric lights = electric lights. Pullman keeps plugging this on and on and on, quite unnecessarily. But he cannot even be consistent, because the English words 'electricity' and 'electron' have managed to slip into the text (where was the editor?) at least once each.<br /><br />7. The editing is appalling. In book 3, I started marking the many places where there are (a) internal inconsistencies, (b) very poor English. I gave up after a while. I had thought of dropping a line to the publishers, but what's the point? They clearly think nothing of insulting the reader's intelligence, and will do nothing about it. Still, it's one more aspect of the general dreadfulness of these books.",0
"Not Good.Just Bad and Ugly.Easily the worst in the trilogy. This is without a doubt one of the worst westerns ever made.I was really disappponted because I thought A Fistful Of Dollars was quite good,and For A Few Dollars More is one of my favourite westerns of all time.But this so-called masterpiece is an abomination.The first two films in the trilogy had an heightened reality,but here nothing is remotely realistic.It's like a spoof that's trying to be artistic.Clint Eastwood returns as a bounty hunter,but sadly he's been been relegated to a supporting role in favour of the hammy,over the top Eli Wallach,playing a Mexican bandit.<br /><br />The plot.What plot? Anybody can write a screenplay where characters just roam around bumping into each other,with a total disregard for logic.So Clint keeps turning wanted man Wallach into the authorities,claims the bounty for his reward,and then before he's hung,he shoots him down and saves his life.He does this a few times,in full view of the sheriff and his posse but the lawmen never chase after them when they escape.Really? And why doesn't Clint become a wanted man himself?<br /><br />Lee Van Cleef plays a contract killer who finds out some information about some missing Confederate army gold.Again no logic here whatsoever.Van Cleef turns up to a man's house to kill him.He threatens his family as well,while the man is fearing for his life.But the man is armed.He's wearing a gun,and there's moments where Van Cleef is too busy eating to do anything,but the man never makes any effort to kill him.Again really? I suppose it's easy to pick apart alot of films when you over analyze them but you don't need to over analyze this film.On first viewing,it just doesn't make sense.It's a complete farce.Clint and Wallach are in the same town as Van Cleef,going about their business while Van Cleef is searching for the man who knows the whereabouts of the gold.Then some time later,Clint and Wallach come across the very man who Van Cleef's been looking for,out in the middle of nowhwere.And then after setting off in search of the gold,the two of them are captured by the Confederate army,and put into a prisoner of war camp,and guess what? Van Cleef just happens to be there,in the disguise of a Union Sergeant.It's just full of convoluted situatons and coincidences like this from start to finish.<br /><br />Director Sergio Leone clearly had no interest in telling a good story,he was too busy just trying to mature his style of filmmaking,and trying to get his anti-war points across.Clint,who I'm a huge fan of,and was great in the first two Dollars films,just sleepwalks through the film.Seriously,he just walks around towns that are been bombed by cannon fire,shooting bad guys,with no interest in hiding or ducking for safety.In the previous films,there was some believability in his character.Here,he's like a cartoon.He's too invincible.By his point,Eastwood was getting sick of making spaghetti weterns,and it shows.He looks like he has no interest in the plot or events going on around him whatsoever.Van Cleef is way too underused as well.He's hardly in the film,and despite his great evil looking presence,he isn't given anything to do.I'll stick with For A Few Dollars More,which in my opinion is the best spaghetti western ever,and the best in this trilogy.I found this film to be overlong,dull,and ridiculous.I'll give it a generous 2 stars just for the presence of Eastwood,and Van Cleef,and some of the music and scenery.I don't ever want to have to sit through it again though.setting off in search of the gold,the two of them are captured by the Confederate army,and put into a prisoner of war camp,and guess what?

"Ok book........ I watched a few of the 15 minute meal programs on TV and decided to give this book a try. I had forgotten that I hadn't liked the 30 minute meals book because Jamie mixes up the recipes in the sequence he makes them but if you don't want to follow the same sequence or if you are making let's say a soup or a dessert then your sequence will be different and you will get all mixed up because the recipes are mashed together. He should also take into account that maybe you don't want to make the salad that comes with that recipe but prefer some other vegetables? What I do is highlight one to be able to separate it from the other. Also I feel that many of the recipes are just too basic: lots of chicken breast and salads. I have only tried the fettucine pasta with smoked trout and I have to say that it is delicious and very easy to make. Another problem I have is with the so-called health advice. Jamie should know all too well that the concept of healthy food nowadays can be just anything, so if I were him I would have stayed away from the subject. He is always talking about guilt free cooking, zero fat yoghurt, the book mentions the calories over a few pages with photos and all..... I find it rather irritating, to be honest! I can understand that Jamie is cooking on TV and that this probably doesn't even come close to his beliefs but... I think that nowadays it is better to stay away from any concept of healthy food if you want to please a lot of people! There is no guilt I in cooking a meal from scratch with good ingredients, there is no harm in eating good fats either! Maybe he doesn't know that......<br /><br />I am not bothered whether one can cook the meals in 15 minutes or not. As a rule the more you make a recipe the fast it goes so that doesn't bother me in the least! All the recipes seem easy enough!",0

"Same goods with some gimmicks. This album goes against itself in a way; the songs take on a more mainstream, repetitive, melodic structure yet try to be different by using a bunch of gimmicky samples and sounds. This may be a way of expressing some sort of myriad of subliminal messages but after a while it becomes boring and tacky. Ultimately, people usually buy an album for the music. So give us music, not garbled radio-EQ'd speech and pitch-bending strings to kill time. This is the most irritating aspect of the album.<br /><br /> The songs themselves are all rather similar to each other as well as to the songs on the album previous to this one, 'Audio Secrecy' e.g. 'Taciturn' to 'Zzyzx Rd.' and 'RU486' and/or `Last of the Real' to 'The Bitter End.' Personally, I don't really mind this too much as I take pleasure in the Stone Sour sound and feel, but it is something to note. The music itself is still enjoyable; there are no bad songs on the album but then again that's because they're all alike. Nonetheless, the sound is powerful with some great moments. The music has its pitfalls but it still shines.<br /><br /> According to Tim New Bound from rocksound.tv the album is \\""""Based on Corey Taylor's fictional tale of a man faced with the choice of growing up or sheltering in the irresponsibility of youth.\\"""" In an interview Taylor himself said that \\""""the story is definitely influenced in a lot of ways... by my journey to figure out who I am,\\"""" and he then goes on to talk about other influences and references, but having read Taylor's book I cannot help but feel that this album is almost entirely an expression of his childhood. This is neither a criticism nor a praise but an observation; often the lyrics merely portray an angsty teenager just shouting and generally being angry at people whilst wanting to \\""""watch the whole world burn.\\"""" However this is another observation and at times I am little annoyed by it but overall it is not something to mark the album down on.<br /><br /> The lyrics are a little tedious. Having listened to all if not most of Stone Sour's material the words and structure have a somewhat overly familiar ring to them. I hesitate to say they are predicable but it would be nice to have something a bit more fresh and original.<br /><br /> Overall, a must for any Stone Sour fan as the band have yet to steer a little more dangerously and evolve. Whilst the music has its irritations it's still enjoyable and meaningful, albeit of the same stuff. On a final note, although not necessarily the band's fault, there are several shameful engineering mistakes within the album. The mix is fantastic, but at this professional level of music production you don't expect to hear crackle and buzz from the guitars/amps, let alone hiss as well as any click track spill from ProTools (the latter most noticeable during the piano of The Travelers, Pt. 2). In fairness however, most people are not bothered by these things.<br /><br />Update: Having listened to this album for a considerable while longer I have found that it has grown on me - in other words I have warmed towards the songs more. However, my view remains the same and although the album may become more appealing to the listener over time as familiarity grows I stand by my verdict of three out of five.us.
